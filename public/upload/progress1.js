      "Description": "Faith, magic, and technology come together in the factory cathedral. Within its walls were produced glorious wonders reserved for the greatest gods and Chosen. Almost none of these wondrous factory cathedrals endure today, and those that remain are terribly damaged or lost to the impassable wilderness. But while practically no one alive could build a factory cathedral today, the Deathlords are some of the few beings that could. Still, only one amongst the Deathlords is officially known to possess an equivalent... And now, you may acquire one of these wonders of dark design. Built as a great tower, this imposing manse has been designed to serve both as a factory cathedral reminiscent of those built in the First Age and as an equally effective Necrosurgery laboratory using more recent designs pioneered by the Deathlords. Unlike the hallowed cathedrals built by the Solars of old, these halls have not been sanctified or constructed as a temple-manse. Instead, special precautions have been taken to ensure the cold, sterile perfection of the Abyssal Essence that powers the horrible machines within. Within these workshops, long forgotten First Age tools are set side by side with just as sophisticated new innovations. Here, eldritch suspension vats preserve the dead. Essence-fueled welding tools fuse bone to bone. Flasks of reagents bubble and strange devices whir, spark, and glow. The place carries about it a dark majesty that scares away most natural animals and invites bad weather, yet the environment stays oddly dry and cool. Black ornaments inset with iron, onyx, and obsidian further channel the manse's Essence into necromantic power, such that the costs of necromantic spells cast within the manse's walls are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the manse bolsters the strength of such spells beyond the capabilities of the necromancer's own Essence. All the better to animate the necrotic war machines one might create within.",
