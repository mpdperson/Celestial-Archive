Gene Roddenberry’s Andromeda
V1.03 Jumpchain / CYOA


by Soulreaper31337


        The Tri-Galaxies are in turmoil, the Systems Commonwealth fell over 300 years ago. Magog, furry bipedal monsters who lay eggs in their victims’ bodies which kill their new parent at birth, have run around unchecked in the tri-galaxies the last three centuries. The Nietzcheans who brought about the downfall of the Commonwealth treat humans and all other races as slaves to do their bidding. Tarn-Vedra, homeworld of the Vedrans - the species responsible for the creation of the Systems Commonwealth - has disappeared along with the Vedrans. There are rumors of Magog super weapons, the second coming of the Nietzchean messiah, Pyrians have been seen again, and the rumors go on forever. One thing is certain the Tri-Galaxies are in need of a savior; here is 1000 CP to prepare for the coming Abyss.




Starting Location: Roll a d6 to determine where you start. Alternatively pay 50 CP to choose your Starting Location.
* 1. Andromeda: The Tenth Glorious Heritage Class Heavy Cruiser built before the fall of the Commonwealth. It has just been pulled out of a black hole by the Eureka Maru. Oddly the ship is still in excellent condition considering... well everything that happened to it.
* 2. Eureka Maru: Beka Valentine's home and cargoship; you better have a good reason to be here.
* 3. Tarazed: Home to the remnants of loyal Commonwealth citizens, High Guard, and even Nietzcheans who escaped the First Systems Commonwealth Civil War.
* 4. Seefra 1: Inhospitable world with a few Oasis Towns. It is weird how many Vedran ruins are in this system. 
* 5 or 6. Free Choice: Choose any location within the setting to start at.


Choose your age and gender. You may be any race or combination of races excluding the Paradine and Celestial Avatars; you can get one or both of those later for CP. If you do purchase Paradine and/or Celestial avatar then you can make those your races.


Origin
Any origin may be considered Drop In, but doing so will give you no memories so you had better be prepared to figure out how things work pretty quick. If you so wish, you can take Commonwealth Officer with another origin. 


* Engineer (Free) - “Note to sculptors - Statues of me should look, I dunno, wise, concerned. I suggest posing me with a soldering wand over my head like a sword.” Seamus Harper
* Android (Free) - “Dylan may not be a god, but on this ship, I am.” - Rommie, Avatar of the Andromeda Ascendant
* Smuggler (Free) - “It takes a minute to find something special in a person, an hour to appreciate them, and a day to love them. But it takes an entire life to forget them.” - Beka Valentine
* Enigma (Free) - "The future? Sometimes it seems like yesterday, sometimes today, sometimes tomorrow. Imagine the possibilities." - Trance Gemini
* Nietzschean (100CP) - "Our people were meant to be living gods, warrior-poets who roamed the stars bringing civilization, not cowards and bullies who prey on the weak and kill each other for sport. I never imagined they'd prove themselves so inferior." - Gaheris Rhade
* Commonwealth Officer (100CP)
“If the Commonwealth's High Guard
had a weakness, it was this:
Its officers were too competent,
too caring, and too brave.”

Perks
One 100 CP Perk is free for each Origin. All Perks are discounted to half price for their respective Origin. Note you can buy perks from any category, they are only discounted for your origin.


General Perks
* Commonwealth Languages (Free/100 CP) - You can speak, read and write the languages most commonly used in the "Tri-Galaxies." For an additional 100CP, you become one of the best linguists in the universe and can easily figure out any languages you hear, speak, read or write in a few hours. 
* Commonwealth of Supermodels (100 CP) - Like nearly everyone in the Tri-Galaxies you are a 10/10. You now have an equally athletic and charismatic build that will always maintain your attractive appearance. You never have to worry about your appearance deteriorating regardless of lack of exercise or food, as long as you consume enough calories to prevent malnourishment. Any injuries will fully heal without scarring, as long as you can naturally heal that wound. Your hair and teeth will always be perfect no matter the situation you are in. 
* Paradine (400 CP) (Capstone Booster for all other 400CP Perks) - You are Paradine. What that means is you are now one of the most powerful sentient species that may have had a hand in the creation of the universe, though it does not necessarily mean both your parents were Paradine. As a Paradine you now have a few gifts that come naturally to you. These include: self-biokinesis, resistance to all damage, resistance to possession and corruption, temporal awareness, matter/energy manipulation, teleportation, telepathic abilities, and time/universe travel. What this means is a Paradine is a hearty person that is naturally attuned to time, space, matter, and energy.


Engineer
* MacGyver (100 CP) - You are a natural at fixing and jury rigging things. As long as you have the parts and tools you can fix nearly anything. You also have the capability to build emergency equipment that can help to save your life and the lives of others, but these tend to be one offs given the time crunch you are usually under.
* Earth Survivor (200 CP) - You are a survivor of Hell or, as it was once known, Earth. Your survival instinct surpases that of anyone else out there; you will never be surprised in a negative way again.
* Jack of all Trades (400 CP) - Like Hohne you are a prodigy at learning all fields of science and engineering. Learning what would take geniuses years in weeks. You can push the limits of science and engineering to new heights, but it will still take time to learn everything that is out there. As an expert on Hohnes level your speciality is that you can make all technology the most efficient possible.
   * Capstone Boosted: Master of all - You are now like Seamus Harper and can learn anything that would take geniuses decades to learn in days. You can still learn non-scientific/engineering things in weeks or months instead of years thanks to your impressive learning skills. Given enough time and knowledge there is nothing you can not claim to be greatest in. You are a master of Harpers caliber and your speciality is miniaturizing all the technology you make, on top of making it as efficient as possible.


Android
* Backup (100 CP) - You can keep a backup of your mind, or someone else's, someplace you trust. As long as the backup is not destroyed you can download the backup into a new body whenever yours is destroyed, assuming you have a backup body. As long as the location of your backup can follow you from jump to jump the backup will remain in its location. If not then you must create a new backup in every jump.
* Perfect Mind (200 CP) - You have a perfect memory with instant recall, unlimited storage, and perfect indexing. You can not lose your memories even if your head is destroyed or time altered. You are also immune to attempts to change your memories and have greater resistance to mental attacks. 
* Commonwealth Knowledge (400 CP) - You now know everything the Commonwealth knew before its fall. 
   * Capstone Boosted: Collector Knowledge - You know everything the Special Collections Division has collected. That is more than you can imagine because they have made it their purpose to preserve all knowledge. You can pick and choose what parts of this knowledge to have in your head if you want.


Smuggler
* Pilot (100 CP) - You can run circles around every other pilot; your skills in any vehicle are considered the top percentile. You are the best of the best when it comes to flying a ship. 
* Treasure Sense (200 CP) - You always seem to be able to find a lead to some hidden treasure, lost ship or hidden technology. You are a natural treasure hunter with an uncanny ability to follow the leads to the next payday.
* Ace (400 CP) - Your danger sense and reaction time make you a rare breed, an Ace. You have the uncanny ability to predict attacks and can respond to them even quicker thanks to your super human reaction times.
   * Capstone Boosted: Ace of Aces - You have the ability to weave in and out of danger without a scratch while piloting a ship and can do the same with a pistol in a firefight.


Enigma
* Quirky (100 CP) - People will overlook anything odd about you, so long as you remain a productive member of the crew… and do not replace yourself with an alternate future version of yourself.
* Nebula (200 CP) - You can give up to 49 willing people copies of all of your perks from this jumpchain, excluding this one. This also prevents the loss, theft, suppression, or removal of all the perks shared with Nebula members. Those who join your Nebula become completely loyal to you, but the only way to be removed from the Nebula is death. 
* Celestial Avatar (400 CP) - Somehow your body has gained the regeneration, immortality, and eternal youth of the Celestial Avatars. You also no longer need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but still can as it does not remove the pleasure from such activities. As an added bonus you are immune to poison, disease, heat, cold, vacuum of space, radiation, and the crushing pressure of celestial bodies. Now you have gained these benefits of the Celestial Avatars without the need for a planet, moon, star, or black hole to sustain it.
   * Capstone Boosted: Celestial Paradine - Your regeneration has improved so you can only die if you are destroyed completely on a physical, mental, and spiritual level at the same time. Your nature has granted you immunity against all instant kill attacks. Finally with enough training you might even evolve your time and universe travel into dimensional travel.


Nietzschean
* Fighter (100 CP) - You are Nietzchean so battle is in your blood. You are an expert at fighting in hand-to-hand, with weapons, with firearms, and in space combat.
* Legacy (200 CP) - You are close enough genetically to qualify for some prophecy or special technology you come across. Any offspring of yours inherit this perk, and you can not be cloned or have kids without your consent.
* Genetic Perfection (400 CP) - You are in peak human condition and every aspect of you is the best that is naturally possible. Your mind and body are working perfectly together at peak efficiency. That peak efficiency extends to preventing your mind and body from being copied without your consent. As an added bonus as a perfect Nietzschean you are in complete control of your body and all of its functions, you can utilize the perfect amount of strength no matter the circumstance or prevent unwanted pregnancies during inopportune times, as long as it is part of yourself you are in complete control of it. 
   * Capstone Boosted: Beyond Perfection - You are a genetic anomaly, but a good one. You are what Nietzche always dreamed of, you have surpassed the limits of what was thought possible and become an Enhanced Human. Every aspect of yourself is enhanced in mind and body. Beyond complete control of your body you now have unlimited potential in everything. The mind and body will also scale up in the case of any species, even those that surpass human limits. You will never stagnate and evolve slowly as time goes on, and as a perfect example of your species you will have control over this evolution.


Commonwealth Officer
* High Guard (100 CP) - You have the training of a high guard officer, congratulations. You know how to operate all Commonwealth technology, are proficient in two bridge stations of your choice for a starship, and have military training of the modern day equivalent of the army.
* My Ship (200 CP) - Any vessel you obtain is yours, you own it. Any government or organization you serve has your loyalty by your and your ship's choice. Jumpchain fiat makes sure that you can stay as loyal to your ship and it does to you.
* Argosy Special Forces (400 CP) - Argosy special forces training made you ready for everything that should, would and could not possibly happen. You are an expert in fighting, reconnaissance, investigation, research, survival, tactics, strategy, piloting, shooting, negotiating, espionage, sabotage and diplomacy.
   * Capstone Boosted: Argosy Special Operations - Una salus victis nullam sperare salutem. The only hope for the conquered is to hope for no safety. The motto of ASO. You are the master in fighting, reconnaissance, investigation, research, survival, tactics, strategy, piloting, shooting, negotiating, espionage, sabotage, assassination and diplomacy.

Android
* Avatar (100 CP) - You have access to a Commonwealth-issue ship’s avatar. If you have the Backup perk above then this is already available as a backup body. If not then it simply becomes an alt-form. Your Avatar is a highly attractive android/gynoid with peak human stats, some minor technological enhancements, and the usual benefits of synthetic life such as not needing food, air or rest. This body can be upgraded if you know how and keeps upgrades in-between jumps. If lost or destroyed you will get a replacement within a week, but if it is destroyed before you can transfer your mind out of it then that counts as death, barring other 1-ups.
* Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum (200 CP) - You somehow have gotten a hold of a pair of automated Planetfall Defense Bots, generally called OEBots. They will defend a location from overwhelming numbers no problem, as they are heavily armored and come with automatic gauss guns and missile launchers.
* Perfect Body (400 CP) - You are in possession of a fully functioning and programmed to your specifications android body with appearance to your liking. This is more “Sturdy” than a standard avatar, it has been built with the best Vedran technology. Built to survive the horrors of the post Commonwealth society, and with blueprints to make more. This body can be upgraded if you know how and keeps upgrades in-between jumps. You can choose for this to be used as a free android companion.
   * For 300 CP less, you can have this be an in jump bodyguard. It will only be for as long as you are in this jump then and does not follow you if you go somewhere else. A smart person could download the memories with a Backup and build a new body in the next jump.








Smuggler
* Hair Nanites (100 CP) - You have nanotechnology in your hair that allows you to change your hair color at will, and you could also use it to store massive amounts of data covertly. This gives you one dose for yourself and schematics to build more.
* Custom Gun (200 CP) - You have the perfect Gauss/coilgun handgun. You get one handgun of your design with whatever additions you want as long as they are possible in the universe. This gun will damage any being whether supernatural, divine, demonic, or mortal; and the gun increases in damage as you grow. If you kill something with this gun it stays dead permanently. It comes standard with infinite ammo, and you can summon it to your hand if lost or stolen.
* Eureka Baru (400 CP) - Ignatius Valentine and Sid Barry built a second cargo ship that is now in your possession.

Enigma

* Garden (200 CP) - You have seeds from every plant in the Andromeda's Hydroponic Garden. With this comes the complete works of Trance Gemini about Herbology.
* Doctor (300 CP) - Trance is the ship's doctor, and now you have all the medical skills of a Commonwealth medical expert.
   * For an additional 100 CP, you have the medical expertise equal to that of Trance Gemini. Billions of years of experience with life, and was able to keep cyborg Beka going well past what should have been possible.


Nietzschean
* Mercenary (100 CP) - You have a wardrobe fit for a highly paid mercenary and a cache of weapons to go with it.
* Garuda Class (200 CP) - You are the proud owner of a Nietzchean patrol craft. They are small and nimble, but armed with missiles and point defense lasers.
   * For an additional 100 CP, it has been upgraded with Slipscout capabilities.
* Asteroid Base (400 CP) - Like many of the great Prides you have your own asteroid base. This base has ship docking capabilities that will even be able to fit a Glorious Heritage Class vessel inside it, while still having room for a few smaller vessels also. It also operates as a refinery, living space, training center, warehouse, multiple airlocks and a staging center. Thanks to the wonders of modern science it has atmosphere in places directly exposed to space and can sustain massive amounts of damage before it falls apart. The downside of this is it has minimal weapons and its engines are only capable of slow movement in the system.
   * For an additional 200 CP, your asteroid has some acquired technology from the Commonwealth, Genites, Magog and Vedrans. Your asteroid base is now a fully functioning space station like Arkology that just happens to be anchored to an asteroid, or not if you do not want a resource full asteroid included. Unlike Arkology it now has defenses and weapons that can outlast a siege from a fleet, can match a slower ship in system for speed, and a working slipstream drive has been added.


Commonwealth Officer
* High Guard Equipment Cache (100 CP) - You are the proud owner of a cache of High Guard armor, weapons, medicine and equipment. 
* Only The Best For The Commonwealth (200 CP) - You are now the proud owner of a house or condo on the planet of your choosing. It is the most luxurious house with all amenities and extras you could possibly want in your home. Alternatively you can upgrade your captain's room in your ship with similar amenities, and if you so wish also improve the rest of the crew quarters to be a bit better.
* Glorious Heritage Class (400 CP) - You are the proud owner of a new Heavy Cruiser Ship or if you so wish you may choose to instead have a different class of ship produced by the Commonwealth, and the paperwork to prove it. Those that have the Jack of all Trades and Commonwealth Knowledge or the capstone boosted perks may choose to use their new found knowledge and specialization to design their own Systems Commonwealth ship. The ship comes fully stocked with all armaments, fully stocked drones, full complement of Slipfighters, a full crew of General Utility Androids, and full complement of Multi-purpose Shipboard Robots. 
   * For an additional 400 CP, you can upgrade your ship with better defensive equipment usually reserved for flagships like better shielding, armor, and stealth capabilities. Even a Point Singularity Projector might not get through these defenses. Speaking of Point Singularity Projectors, you now have three of them integrated into your ship. Your drone capacity is immensely increased along with increased control capacity for your drones; Seraphim drones will now be inferior to yours. Lastly your ship’s systems like power, engines, automation, computers, and everything in-between has been upgraded. You can safely say your ship has the best engine, computers, more power than you can ever need, and every extra feature a flagship could ever need. 
Companions
* Single Import/ Companion Creation (50 CP for one and up to 200 CP for eight) - You may import or create a companion. They get 600 CP to spend on the options presented. These Companions can only take Drawbacks that directly affect them, and you can transfer CP from yourself to a Companion, at a 1:1 ratio. You are free to decide the personality, history and appearance of created Companions and they will accept their created companion status. Any transferred CP will apply to all companions, not just one.
* Recruitment (100 CP) - With each purchase of this you can attempt to recruit a known person from the Andromeda Universe. You have the full duration of your stay to do this. If they are a Celestial Avatar they will have to relinquish the Celestial Body they are tied to, but will retain their immortality and most of their other abilities.
* Full Crew (100 CP) - A full crew full whatever you might need from staffing your warship to running a shipping/salvaging chain, fully loyal and insanely competent at their positions. You may upgrade your Nietzschean pride with this to make your whole crew your pride and any bought companion perks will still apply to the ship's pride now.
* Pride (100 CP) - You are the Alpha of your own pride of Nietzcheans. This will be a small pride of up to 100 that are completely loyal to you. You can decide the makeup of the pride, whether that’s all women for your harem or all warriors ready to fight for you. 
   * For 100 CP, you can treat the pride as companions and spend up to 600 CP of perks that will apply to all of them but they can only have discounts on Nietzschean perks. You may take drawbacks that can apply to the pride and can transfer CP with a 1:1 ratio also.
Drawbacks
No limit on drawbacks. If you take “Hunted” and “Magog What!” you can choose to have those drawbacks affect your companions so they gain the same CP from them, but they also become targets of those drawbacks.
* Fanfiction (+0) - You enter the world of an Andromeda Fanfiction instead of the canon andromeda. If you can’t find one to your liking, then write one.
* Variety (+100) - While the characters in the universe will be the same, the same can not be said for their gender or species. Expect to see a bit more diversity around the universe.
* Crossover (+100 CP) - You can crossover this with another franchise of your choosing.
* Previous Timeline (+200 CP) - You start in the timeline where Dylan Hunt was killed by his friend Gaheris Rhade.
* Idealist (+200 CP) - You apparently missed the memo that you’re not on Star Trek  You are now fully committed to living up to the highest ideals of civilization, which is a great thing in theory but sometimes fails in practice when you’re confronting the reality of a post-apocalyptic cyberpunk-themed galactic balkanization chock-full of literally murderous intrigue. You don’t shoot to kill first, you always deal in good faith until the other guy cheats you first, you basically don’t do anything nasty to the other guy first, and you don’t even like doing it second. And if sheer do-it-or-die necessity ever forces you to compromise your lofty ideals or the laws and standards of a now-defunct Commonwealth, then you will angst about it for days. 
* Hunted (+300 CP) - You are now being hunted by a group; you may take this up to five times. These groups will not come after you at the same time and they will not work together to take you down, but they will not sit out and wait for you. They will set up ambushes and track you down to attack when you are weak. The following are the groups hunting you and what you get with each purchase in order. 
   1. A Restorian destroyers with a two dozen fighters
   2. Nietzschean Pride will come after you with four Battlecruisers and 40 Garuda
   3. The Pyrians wish to test your resolve and you will now face three Pyrian Torchships
   4. Two Genite Seraphim Carriers will now be after you
   5. A Collector group will come after you with two Siege Perilous class ships.
* Noticed (+300) - After your first encounter with civilization, every organization and government will be aware of you. You can still go undetected on worlds, but any world you visit might increase security upon your arrival.
* No Ad-Libbing (+400 CP) - You have no access to any out-of-jump powers or supernatural abilities for the duration of this jump.
* Framed (+400) - Once during your adventures here you will be framed for a murder of a person of some importance. If you fail to clear your name you will gain a bounty that only the most loyal of friends would not turn you in for.
* Proprietary Technology (+500 CP) - You now have no access to your Warehouse or any out-of-jump items or technology for the duration of this jump.
* Dylan Who? (+600 CP) - You are now the captain of the Andromeda Ascendant, just as the ship is being hauled out of the black hole by Beka’s salvage crew in the pilot episode. If you purchased a Glorious Heritage Class ship then it starts out fully stocked and will have all upgrades you purchased. If you don’t then you just get the canon one, and none of it follows you out of the jump when you’re done. You must restore the Commonwealth, defeat the Magog World Ship, defeat the Nietzcheans, and save the Seefra system within 10 years.
* Magog What! (+700 CP) - You will see two Magog Satellite Ships eventually come after you or a planet you are visiting if you stay too long in the same place. These can be destroyed with a bit of work, but the thousands of Magog Swarm ships will most likely have been launched before that. To top it off the ships can strip mine a planet of all natural resources after sending out its massive crew to invade a planet or ship.

________________


Notes:
* Thanks to by Insertrandomnickname who made Generic Jump for this template
* Thanks to Nerx on the Jumpchain Reddit for supplying resources to figure this out
* Andromeda and Eureka Maru are obvious starting locales, and Terazed and Seefra 1 make sense since they are important to the story.
* I know i left Rev Bem out as a background option, but the guy that was only on the show less than two seasons
* Allowing Commonwealth Officer to dual Origin with another makes sense given the inclusive nature of the Commonwealth
* Thanks to reminders from others i forgot i have no 50 cp perks or items so it is now 100, 200, 400 perks
* Paradine as a Capstone Booster makes sense given the deifying nature of them, as stated by Kevin Sorbo himself. Resistance to possession & corruption added after rewatching the series, it nearing Immune but Dylan still had moments of weakness. Reworded perk to have complete self biokinesis. Reworded durability to resistance and all damage type since Dylan survived alot of attacks that killed others. In case anyone doesn't know the capstone perk includes everything from the base perk.
* Language and Super model make sense given the setting for the first and the beauty of everyone for the second
* Seamus was the MacGyver of Andromeda and mentioned how Earth forged him into who he was. The Learning and capstone boosted learning reflect how he regularly became an expert if not master on whatever scientific or engineering field they needed for the episode or season. Added efficient speciality to Jack of all Trades and miniaturization and efficiency to Master of all, this was done to make the perk more in line with the value of the other boosted perks.
* Rommie having a backup is easy, but her perfect recall for many situations meant adding a perfect and unlimited perk to reflect that. The Knowledge of the Commonwealth and Collectors knowledge was the best way to reflect the information dump that Rommie and Andromeda were for many episodes. Collector knowledge would include all Vedran, Pyrian, and Magog.knowledge.
* Beka valentine is the best pilot, loves adventures that lead to money, and has better danger sense and reaction time than any else in the Tri-Galaxies
* Trance’s quirky ways is eas, but the main trait of hers is her immortal nature so her big purchase along with capstone boosted immortality
* Replaced Trance's Trickster perk with Nebula after rewatching the series. It reflects the shared nature of the Avatars, trickster was merged with thieves tools item
* Celestial Paradine now upgrades paradine resistance, made regeneration apply to mind and soul also to reflect near unkillable aspect of celestials, and with training dimension travel might be possible. Moved the rest to Celestial Avatar.
* Nietzscheans are natural fighters and Tyrs end around with the prophecy explain Legacy
* The Perfect and Beyond Perfection are all about the drive of the Nietzcheans to be the best they can be. Genetic Perfection gives the user Peak Human Condition if one looks it up on a superpower wiki, basically they are the best in all categories for their species. Beyond Perfection is basically what all Nietzcheans strive for and I would call the equivalent of Enhanced Condition for the individual that receives it, basically an augmented or super soldier for the race they belong to. This applies to you so if you are human then you are superhuman, if you are nietzschean then you are super nietzschean. Added body and mind copy prevention to perfect, this reflects the nearly Holy nature of DNA to the Nietzcheans.
* The High Guard training is easy, the Ship perk is because after everything Andromeda was Dylans, not the Commonwealth's ship. The Argos perks are to reflect the insane skill set that Dylan had
* Andromeda merch was a gimmie, Slipfighter for a cheap spacecraft, and renown reflects the fame and infamy everyone has that goes with their speciality
* Data port, data mining, and lab all reflect seamus and his tinkerer & adventurer nature
* Android origin giving you an android body of your own makes sense, Tweedle dee & dumb reflect the extra manpower she brought with her when needed. The Perfect body is giving the possibilities of infinite lives for an android and reflecting her journey throughout the series to be one of the most human characters.
* Smuggler - Covert way to smuggle - check, custom gun - check, and fast ship - check
* Trance is a thief, loves nature, and is a skilled doctor when she feels like it
* Nietzcheans and their wardrobe and weapons enough said, and Garuda is a named ship in series while the battlecruiser is never actually named so I went with the weaker ship for purchase. The Kodiak asteroid was very important to the story so I added an asteroid base with an upgrade to make it comparable to Arkology but with defenses. Nietzchean companion pride now moved to companions.
* Commonwealth equipment is a must, luxurious rooms were a common theme when visiting so added that, and have to have the Glorious Heritage Class ship to purchase. I added a few additional things to purchase because while not said in series it is implied with certain newer Commonwealth ships and with Genites that technology still advanced so i added options seen in other ships or implied to exist - Yes full armaments does include nova bombs, it is standard for the ship.
* For companions you can have you nietzscheans take paradine and celestial avatar with enough drawbacks, 5 levels of hunted and magog for 2200cp extra, let's just say at this point your pride are nietzscheans with paradine and celestial avatar genetics added in for greater perfection if you do this. The reason I allow you to double up with certain drawbacks is because if you are separated from your pride or companions they can be a victim of that drawback if they can not defend themselves, plus if you can defeat each tier of enemies once another set for each companion would not make much difference so having to risk losing the companion or pride before you defeat the threats is a good risk.
* Drawbacks, well first two are to reflect the limited nature of the stories online for andromeda. The hunted reflects some of the factions that were adversaries for the Andromeda. Dylan Who is a drawback that forces you to be the one to save the day, and let's be honest Dylan Hunt only succeeded because he is a literal deity. Last one is a challenge perk because Andromeda got lucky against the Magog satellite, a thousands of kilometer long base with thousands of fighters and can strip mine anything is a greater threat than reflected in the show. 
* For drawbacks applying to companions, be aware if you apply it to companions they also might be targeted when you are separated unless you have already taken care of the threats. I have it working this way because there were episodes where the threat decided to go after the crew instead of Dylan so it fits in the universe.
* Thanks to cglasgow and Mac Ibach for a lot of additions and fixes to this jump
