--- Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills (16) (122 Perks) --- 




-'Download' Blueprints (Heat Signature) (100CP)
        You know or obtain the general layout of any ship you enter. Applies to buildings too, radius 50m.


-Analysis (Red Alert 3) (100CP)
        You can immediately identify any defects in hardware upon casual observation. This is effective on devices, Vehicles, and buildings.


-By the Numbers (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (100CP)
        You know how much of any given resource your industries and organizations are producing, and how much potential for production there is for each resource.


-Demonic Augmentation (Hellgate London) (100CP)
        You can successfully graft demonic parts onto yourself to gain an increase in mana reserves as well as gaining the ability to more easily cast certain spells based on the demon's type. You also learn to craft demonic focus items that, while weaker than augmentations, also don't have to be grafted onto your body.


-Engineer (Megas XLR) (100CP)
        You're a talented and knowledgeable multi discipline engineer, particularly skilled in everything you could ever need to maintain Megas and similar war machines.


-Engineering Basics (Dead Space) (100CP)
        You're a real Mr. Fix-It, y'know? Malfunctioning fuel intake? Easy. Faulty asteroid defense cannon? Turn it off, then on again. Non-responsive communications array? Shuffle the working emitters around a bit so they're symmetrical. Undead monstrosities? Depends on what you mean by, "fix." Does using a rivet gun to blow them apart count? Yes? Then we're good.


-Green Eye (Earth Girls) (100CP)
        The most important skill for an herbalist is to tell what a plant is, of course. You can identify by sight or smell alone every plant that grows for miles around and tell if a plant you've never seen before is edible or toxic.


-I Know Things (Marvel Cosmic) (100CP)
        What use is genius if no one will listen? How can one save the day or take over the galaxy if they are ignored? This ensures that will never be a problem for you. You know things and people know that. They will no longer scoff at or ignore your scientific ramblings so long as you know what you are talking about. You can always convince people to accept facts so long as you can explain them. People will also accept your knowledge of things as equivalent to a physical item of equal value when discussing bartering or trading. You can't bullshit with this perk. You have to actually be right and know the thing for it to be taken seriously.


-IMPACT CALIBRATION (PREY) (100CP)
        Also known as percussive maintenance. You're good at repairing things, simple items can be repaired with a few spare parts and a wrench, which is fortunate because most of Talos I's equipment is simple for ease of fabrication. Of course you can fix almost anything with the right parts and a little time and now know just the right way to smack an item with a wrench to fix minor faults (Or knock someone dead).


-Legion Trained (A Practical Guide to Evil) (100CP)
        One Sin. Defeat. One Grace. Victory. These are the words that every member of the Legion lives by. You've been trained in the legions, and are proficient with rank-to-rank fighting with the gladius and scutum, the usage of goblin munitions, and mass spellcasting (assuming, of course, that you're capable of spellcasting). Furthermore, you know how to create goblin munitions, including the magic-eating goblinfire. While this won't let you stand up to a Hero on it's own, the discipline of a legionnaire and their skill against others on their level is not to be doubted. As one of the Named yourself? Well, this level of skill can be quite effective, though it's enhanced with the assistance of fellow warriors.


-MacGyver (Andromeda) (100CP)
        You are a natural at fixing and jury rigging things. As long as you have the parts and tools you can fix nearly anything. You also have the capability to build emergency equipment that can help to save your life and the lives of others, but these tend to be one offs given the time crunch you are usually under.


-Medicine (GUNNM) (100CP)
        You have the skills of a surgeon, first-responder and pharmacist, all roughly bundled together with a lot of hands-on experience with the worst injuries the wasteland has to offer. Your hands are steady, your focus unperturbed by the sight and stench of gore and viscera, and you have the precise and quick reflexes necessary to swat a fly with a scalpel. You also have a fair bit of experience with slightly inhuman and mutated physiology, and are very quick to pick up on new techniques and tools.


-Programming (World Seed) (100CP)
        Through hard hours spent slaving over a hot keyboard you have learned the art of programming, you could write a program for pretty much anything, please don't try to steal peoples bank accounts.


-Resourcefulness (Generic Xianxia) (100CP)
        You instinctively know how to make the best with what you have. You know that a rope can be burned as well as tied, that water can drown as well as cleanse, and that spiritual power can be used to do much more than simply destroy. You also have a very good idea of what an ability or skill can do, even out of context - a punch can shake fruit off of their branches, a technique that generates fire can be used to cook and cauterize, and dangerous wild beasts can be goaded into attacking your adversaries. In short, you understand how to use your abilities and resources at hand in creative ways that many would not have considered, potentially giving you an advantage against more rigid or less creative opponents.


-Rites of Maintenance (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
        While already designed to be incredibly robust, Imperial equipment inevitably requires maintenance. You can locate and identify problems within a machine in a fraction of the time it would take other adepts. Not knowing how a machine functions does not make fixing it any more difficult so long as you have the proper parts, tools, and rituals to guide your hands.


-Run the numbers (Factorio) (100CP)
        Mining rigs produce a certain amount of resources per hour, which travel along conveyors at a certain speed, and a certain number are consumed by assembly machines at a certain rate, varying for each product as determined by the construction time and the loading and unloading speed of the inserters. That's a lot of math, but you can handle it. You can juggle dozens of numbers in your head without forgetting anything, and your brain now has the equivalent of a built-in scientific calculator to perfectly solve any mundane equation you can throw at it. You'll also get a crash course in advanced mathematics and the know-how to create those equations you'll need solved.


-SOFTWARE SCIENTIST (PREY) (100CP)
        The computer scientists on the station are some of the best in the world, developing next generation interfaces and security systems for sale back on earth. You have significant experience with the computer systems utilised by TranStar, and more specifically, all the back doors. With a little effort no door or computer on Talos will be secure when you're around. And due to your extensive knowledge of computer theory hacking into different architectures is possible with significantly less effort than learning it from scratch, from a day to a basic but completely alien system to a few months for the most plugged up and secure system.


-Technical Expertise (Generic Cyberpunk) (100CP)
        People use technology every day but that doesn't mean they understand or are skilled with it. You're not one of them. You're a deft hand at working with and understanding technology and machines, picking up anything you need to know to use and work with them easily. Given anything more than just a passing familiarity you'll be a whiz with it, able to work magic when you get your hands on the inner workings of whatever you're dealing with. Whether that's peeling apart computers and piecing hardware back together to make a much better system, tweaking software in ways that make it run like a dream, or working magic in a garage with vehicles that have seen better days nobody can deny you have the talent.


-Tinker (9 Jumpchain) (100CP)
        You have an eye for what might be useful and how to put it together, giving you a great skill at on-the-fly crafting of all manner of tools from improvised materials. You may even do so rather quickly, provided that you have the right things on hand for what you want to do.


-Trained Technician (Battletech) (100CP)
        You may not understand why this works but you can make it work and fix it when it doesn't. Pick one sort of mechanical system (jumpdrives, fusion reactors, myomer limbs) and you've the ability to repair or even construct these as long as you've minimal access to parts and tools.


-UAC Trained (DOOM 3) (100CP)
        You must learn to walk before you can run, and much the same is true in the field of science. You're well-versed in the use of a wide variety of high-tech equipment, especially when it comes to maintenance and such challenges as 'how to prevent accidental death and dismemberment' when working with all manner of high-energy systems. From logbooks detailing incidents and causes to proper Personal Protective Equipment, you've got all the skills you need to thrive in an environment where demonic incursions weren't needed to leave more than a few scientists and engineers dead from misuse of equipment.


-Wired Watchmaker (Arcanum: Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura) (100CP)
        Long hours hunched over the machinery and books that define your profession have left you with a keen eye for detail. Your eyesight is excellent even in the occasionally poorly-lit workshops you frequent, and your mind has sharpened to the point you'll easily remember the details of any schematic you're trying to assemble. You can still wear that monocle of course, but this time, you'll wear it for style!


-Wisdom of the Ancients (Dinotopia) (100CP)
        You were born with the instinctual knowledge and taught the oral history of your kin's long epic, one that stretches back millions of years. You know countless secrets about the earth and her children, and most of all how to live in peace with all. The skill also allows you to gain whatever knowledge that dinosaurs or equivalent species had about the world by simply making physical contact with their fossils or other remains (or live bodies, in some cases). This knowledge includes how to speak their ancient tongues.


-Solid Foundations (ARIA) (150CP)
        On a planet covered in water, ensuring that there are stable foundations to build on is critical to ensuring that anything built remains intact. While your work doesn't have as much to do with architecture, your expertise does afford you a bit of understanding in what's needed to form stable landmasses and building upon them. If they really wanted to, the Gnome could probably have set up a monorail system in Neo Venetia by now but it would certainly destroy the atmosphere!


-Accumulated Mastery (Lords of the Night - Vampire) (200CP)
        Anyone can learn the 'basics' of a craft. Most people can become competent, if their fickle nature doesn't betray them. Mastery though requires commitment. At least, that's what you've been told. This doesn't help you learn a skill - instead, it lets you take a skill you've already gotten to a solid point, and lets you push it to the level of preternatural mastery. Instead of slowing down and growing more difficult, your learning becomes easier and speeds up when it hits the normal point of diminishing return.
        Eventually you'll hit a new plateau, but it's well on the far side of 'inhuman.' This will usually take about as much time and effort as it took you to become a journeyman in that skill in the first place.
        This is limited to skills, but isn't limited to things DnD thinks are skills.


-Astrophysics (ARIA) (200CP)
        Have you been accused of bringing down meteors yet? Haha, that's just a joke - but as part of your training, you've also studied extensively into the workings behind astral bodies. Are we going to rehash over your lessons? Nah, you probably won't need them in your time in Aqua anyways. Might help you a little if you ever decide to leave, I suppose. Astrophysics tend to be quite in demand in other parts of the solar system I hear Manhome...sorry, Earth, is especially eager to get more terraforming projects deployed.


-Baboom (Smash Up) (200CP)
        You're an expert in demolitions, all forms of explosive and incendiary devices. You know how to handle them safely, where and how to emplace them to best effect, and can calculate safe areas to the centimeter in your head. All such devices seem at least half-again as potent when you trigger them.


-Behind the Shadows (Honor Harrington) (200CP)
        There is more to technology than just big booms, you know. Oh yes, you do. You are utterly incredible at all kinds of stealth based technologies. You can build up infrastructure and shipyards in total secrecy, with not a soul becoming aware, and the results tend to be some of the best cloaked and concealed ships and weapons in the galaxy. The spider drive, with all of the supporting tech needed for it, is only one of the examples of what you're capable of with this perk.


-Climatology (ARIA) (200CP)
        Well, when you only do a single thing all day, it's only expected that you eventually become a subject matter expert right? When it comes to the science behind controlling and modifying weather - yeah that's your niche alright. Anything related to the weather is something you can pick up and incorporate into other things with only a fair bit of effort.


-Computers (Star Wars KOTOR) (200CP)
        Droids, networks, and personal computers are your playthings. You're an expert at manipulating and improving digital devices, and you can cut through most security systems like a lightsaber through butter.


-Crafting & Repairing (Scooby Gamers) (200CP)
        You are a rising star in crafting and hand-working. With some time and effort becoming an expert in any sort of crafting you set your mind to is entirely possible. You are also extremely talented at repairing damaged items and figuring out their functions - so long as you've got the time and the resources, you could put back together even devices and artefacts you've otherwise got no clue as to the function of or that would otherwise be irreparable. This works as a training booster for crafting, letting you learn crafting skills three times faster than before.


-Crafting Tree (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
        Ordinarily, you have to have all of the ingredients for a crafted item in hand, and be near the right crafting station in order to gain the mental recipe for it. Now, however, you can pick any item that you have, and gain a mental list of the recipes that item can be used for. This includes the other items needed for a given recipe, as well as what sort of crafting station, if any, is needed to actually successfully build it.


-Dark Sciences (Marvel Cosmic) (200CP)
        Science is a tool like any other but oh how useful of a tool it is. However you rule, however you carry out your conquests, your might is made only mightier by the strength of your dark sciences. You know how to unleash the most destructive aspects of any science or technology you understand. You know how to turn any of your knowledge to evil or destruction. Are you a master of the healing sciences? Well now you know how to create terrible viruses and cancers. Are you a mechanical engineer? The universe has never seen such dastardly torture devices. Every last piece of knowledge you have can be tuned for maximum destruction.


-Discerning Eyes of Wisdom (Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension) (200CP)
        You have an encyclopedic knowledge of spirit materials, magical treasures, and other things of that nature, and can identify them with only a short glance. Additionally, you're able to accurately determine their fair market value in any market you know of. If such items are auctioned off, they will never go for less than your estimate.


-Educated guess (Factorio) (200CP)
        Your subconscious mind works overtime to sort and fact-check everything you know, granting you a sort of poor man's precognition. In the field, your hunches are uncanny in their accuracy (but knowing false information can return wrong answers.) In the laboratory, this vastly speeds up your work as you quickly identify problems, test for the right thing the first time, and are directed to asking the right questions to find the best solutions. The more you know about a subject, the more this perk helps you.


-Engineer (Freefall) (200CP)
        Years of education and on the job experience led you here. It could be inventing or fixing starship technology, analyzing and carefully releasing parasites so that future generations flourish, or literally designing the body and minds of robots or biological constructs. You might not be the very best in the universe, but odds are you're the best that anyone around you would be likely to meet.


-Experienced Eye (Final Fantasy IV) (200CP)
        Spending so much time on experiments which tend to explode in your face (or the faces of your assistants) has given you a keen eye when it comes to potential. You just get how things work without needing to study it for long at all. Whether machine, or organic, you understand what it does, and how to dismantle it with ease.


-Eyes of the Industrialist (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (200CP)
        While looking at pieces of an industrial or logistic system, you are able to tell facts about them. These facts include efficiency, purpose, owner, contents, what other pieces feed into them, what other pieces they feed, consumption rates of resources, and other similar statistics. By limiting yourself to a single statistic about the parts, you may quickly skim over large numbers of different pieces and compare them in that statistic.


-Hardware (Star Wars KOTOR) (200CP)
        Gives you training in how to operate, repair and improve machines. You can easily rebuild broken droids from salvaged parts, and you'll even be able to fix starships given enough time and equipment.


-Hit a Key, Any Key (Generic Video Game Developer) (200CP)
        Your coding and typing speed is increased dramatically, with your average WPM speed easily being over 150, and with some practice getting up to over 200 won't be much of a problem. What's better is that you will now never mistype, meaning all words will be spelled as intended and you'll never accidentally hit the wrong key. This will also boost your handwriting and drawing speed a good deal, although not quite as much as your typing ability.


-Inconceivable Hacking Skills (Limitless) (200CP)
        Quentin Walker, a genius tech researcher from CRAFT, once remarked that there are only a handful of minds on the planet that can hack his projects. Well jumper, you are now part of that handful even without having to use NZT. In addition this perk lets you just type really fast on a computer instead of having to actually do the hacking, and almost any computer's security will crumble to your flailing fingers.


-Innovation-Inator (Phineas and Ferb) (200CP)
        When you have an idea, you just want to run with it, and now you can. Just by coming up with an idea for a device, you'll start to get impressions for how to go about building it, what parts you'll need, and what sort of esoteric principles it will function on. You'll still have to do the actual building, and taking shortcuts around pieces you don't have the parts for could lead to problems later, but eh, you'll bounce back if it blows up in your face.


-Machines, They Just Speak To Me (Firefly) (200CP)
        You have no formal schooling, but can fine-tune and repair engines with nothing but shoe polish. You don't know what the parts are SUPPOSED to do, but you know how to make them work the way you want. You can diagnose a faulty part in the power core just by listening to the AC cycle, and can fix pretty much anything with naught but a wrench and some duct tape. It may not be pretty, and it may not last long, but it'll work.


-MEDICAL DOCTORATE (PREY) (200CP)
        Talos has no shortage of medical assistance, keeping the crew in top physical condition and studying the effects of Neuromods on the human psyche. Almost everyone in the Neuromod department has some medical background. Now you do too, either through your own education or through Neuromod injection. Basic medical supplies work better in your hands, sutures are guaranteed to hold through everything but the harshest of abuse and wounds cleaned by you never get infected. With more advanced supplies you're on par with the world's best heart surgeons. As a bonus, you can also identify and remove organs from the Typhon that a rich in the exotic material used in making Neuromods.


-Neuromancer (Generic Cyberpunk) (200CP)
        You've mastered the arts of interfacing machines and the human mind, able to both design and build things to seamlessly interface with the human nervous system and the actual consciousness housed within it. Building an implant or accessory to let people access the net with just a thought wouldn't be difficult at all, neither would making sure that a cybernetic connects so seamlessly with the user that it feels more natural than their original arm. You've also mastered the use of such a simple if almost magical technology, not just it's construction. Combined with some programming skills, full immersion Virtual Reality would easily be within your grasp. You've bridged the gap between mind and machine, it's up to you to discover where you go with it from here.


-Omni-fix (Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (200CP)
        Tech support is difficult... for other people. You can quickly diagnose any problems with any machine, and if you know the problem you know the solution to it. This doesn't provide tools or materials though, and doesn't help you fix poor design.


-Powered Productivity (DOOM 3) (200CP)
        Why are there so many excessively high-powered systems employed in the UAC Mars base? Well, at its most basic because it works. Brute force might be lacking in elegance, but there is nonetheless a certain charm to deciphering ancient hieroglyphs with a computer mainframe the size of a ten-story building, or getting started on a terraforming project with what could charitably be called a self-sustaining nuclear fusion system. You're adept at using such immense volumes of raw energy and potential, and can easily find ways to turn challenging but complex problems into well, equally challenging but decidedly simpler problems with a suitable application of raw power. Not only that, but you also possess a high degree of skill in making sure these kinds of energy use don't lead to further problems, like unbalancing the power grid or burning out the circuitry. It might not be pretty, but without asking yourself 'why not try more power?', would the UAC ever have developed such mighty new technologies as the Plasma Rifle or the BFG-9000?


-Programmer (Stargate Atlantis) (200CP)
        You're seriously competent at the art of programming, even to the extent of adapting programs to run on alien computer architecture. You could debug kernel code in your sleep (and maybe you have). If you can (or learn to) read Lantean or Wraith this includes programming in their software languages.


-Real Research (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (200CP)
        Improving the fundamentals is hard, unrewarding, and necessary. No number of new ninth circle spells will change the world. Casting such creations is more art than science, and limited to an elite few. Making a better Magic Missile can change the world.
        You know how to improve things starting at the basics. You could figure out how to improve Magic Missile, a bit. And use that improvement to improve all first circle force spells that throw the force effect. And from there improve all first circle force spells. And from their all second level force spells... And so on.
        You can share the products of your research, too. Some techniques might be easy, maybe a change to the spell itself. Others might be harder, techniques for maximizing what you get out of already built spells.
        You could use this to improve anything you understand on a deep technical level.
        The perk comes with deep technical knowledge of death, undeath, Negative Energy, and how tainted forces interact with the physical world, and how they can be manipulated to support dark spells and the raising of undead.


-Robert the Builder (Invincible) (200CP)
        You can seemingly build and organize anything with far less hassle and for greater results than most would experience. You are able to be the driving force behind projects large enough to affect entire countries or maybe even the world in its entirety. Somebody 'glassed' Las Vegas? Don't worry, you could lead a project to turn it into the world's largest and most efficient solar farm that can provide cheap electricity to Half of America. Some super villain messed with the tides the world over? You, with the help of some geniuses, would be able to successfully direct the building of a secondary artificial moon to set the tides to right. Truly, the sky itself isn't a limit.


-Security Worm (Hive Queen Quest) (200CP)
        Some people think firewalls and passwords are enough to keep a hacker out, they would be right in most cases too except they didn't count on you. Your ability to hack and crack systems passwords is astounding and anything short of a complete physical disconnect in a system is simply another way for you to gain access. Somebody ordered Chinese food on the company Wi-Fi? You can probably get into their network servers in a few minutes while they place the order.


-Shielded Turbines (Subnautica) (200CP)
        You know how to close systems efficiently, protecting them from foreign matter. No longer will fish gum up your intake valves, or weeds tangle your propellers. Also makes your vehicles much quieter, which is handy in Reaper territory.


-Stone-age Otaku (Earth Girls) (200CP)
        It takes a lot of patience and a lot of repetition to make a good blade from a stone. You don't bore, at all, and your hands are always steady. Between different attempts at the same task, you can pick out the tiniest differences between the last attempt and the attempt before that (and the ones before that...) to work out precisely what needs to be tried the next time.


-The Conveyors Will Run On Time (Factorio) (200CP)
        Or you could let a computer do all the work. You have the programming skills needed to automate a massive assembly complex, having dozens, even hundreds of disparate machines working smoothly together. Your skill is enough to program 'fuzzy' logic into your machines. This is far from actual sapience, but they will know not to waste energy or compound problems by blindly following irrelevant, contradictory or self-destructive programming. Your defensive systems also work more intelligently, leading targets, prioritizing more dangerous enemies based on the current situation, and not being distracted by decoys.


-Uncommonly Good Common Sense (Freefall) (200CP)
        While this alone won't turn you into a genius nor give you information you didn't already have, it will help you in applying your knowledge. Any time that something you already know becomes relevant that information comes to mind immediately, without causing any distress or distraction. You'll never make the same mistake twice and might not even make it once. Plans that have problems or contradictions in them become obvious. If you were an expert pickpocket you would never fall for someone else using your own tricks against you, and even if you had always been on the straight and narrow if some Squid bumps into you and tries to sell you a watch that coincidentally matches the one you just lost you'll be able to realize that it is in fact yours. One free suggestion for buyers of this perk, reading about the scientific method as well as logical fallacies would be a great help for you.


-Weaver's Children (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (200CP)
        A natural or unnatural affinity for technology, just by looking at and listening to the whispers of the spirits, they can get a basic sense of how technology works and how to use it.


-What's This Doohickey? (Campione) (200CP)
        Ah, supernatural powers. They don't come with an instruction manual, be it the magic of mortals, the Authorities of Gods or something else entirely, one needs to get their exact limits and improve themselves by trial and error. Well not anymore, this little blessing works to take care of that. Now, you gain an innate knowledge of how to use any new powers you acquire, as well as their limitations and advantages. Doesn't sound like much until you get a power-up in the middle of a battle and you realize you don't know how to use it. Embarrassing.


-With Me Always (Warlock of The Magus World) (200CP)
        The A.I chip of Leylin wasn't originally part of Leylin's being. Originally, it was an item created in another world and when he was killed, the chip merged with his soul becoming one with him, less of an item and more of a power. Whether through research, experimentation or just good luck, you have found a way to accomplish this act. Whenever you desire, you can destroy any item and merge it with your soul, becoming one and the same. Allowing you to possess all the abilities the item once possessed. Remember as Leylin grew stronger so did the chip, now so do any items that you merge with your soul. In addition you can reverse the merger of any such item at will.


-Wizard of Wisdom (World Seed) (200CP)
        Mages are known as the foremost researchers and scientists in the galaxy, responsible for most of the magitech used in the galaxy in place of mundane technology. Then, if you were to focus on magic yourself, would it not be appropriate to have the same skillset? Certainly, your natural ability in these disciplines would make you a welcome guest in any mage society. You have the grit it takes to repeat an experiment as many times as it takes to get results, know how to be objective in all things related to your job and look at things without any biases, even subconscious ones, and live with the tenets of the scientific method in your mind.
        Most importantly of all, you have an intuitive and instinctive understanding of scientific principles. Even if you were a farm boy with no formal education to speak of, just a few years of schooling could get you to the point where you would make observations and discoveries that would impress even people with PhDs in those fields. This scales with your knowledge and expertise, so I have high expectations if you were already smart before getting this perk. You also won't get bogged down with false positives or negatives: in anything you do or try, you know whether it is possible at all, and if you get a result, whether it is truthful, and if it is not, what you can do to make it so.
        Yet another problem that many scientists face is the lacking relevancy and application of their research in real life. But no more. At any time, you have an instinctive knowledge of what you should prioritize in your research. Some madman is trying to conquer the galaxy in secret? You'll get a hunch that it might be time to work on that antimatter generator again. The aftereffects of a supernova will cook your planet with radiation in a few years? A spark of inspiration will cause you to create vastly improved radiation shields and implement them planetwide for a test run. From a certain perspective, it really does look like the hand of a God is guiding your scientific aspirations. Do you have blue skin, perchance?


-MACHINE MIND III (PREY) (250CP)
        By consuming Psi you can manipulate the micro switches in an electronic device, effectively hacking into it and turning it to your side for a few moments. The time you can remotely control a machine is extended indefinitely in exchange for a small constant consumption of Psi and you can control up to 5 machines at once.


-Build and Craft Menu (The Dark Wolf Shiro) (300CP)
        What kind of gamer would you be if you relied on others for something as trivial as construction or crafts? With this perk you have gained access to the build and craft menus that allow for instantaneous work; So long as you have the resources,you can now create and customize any building, hideout or location that you own, whether adding more rooms, buying and placing furniture or just increasing the size of the available space.
        You can also modify any and all of your items in the same way, smithing swords, crafting items and brewing potions just by accessing the menu so long as you have the needed resources in your inventory, it all gets done in an instant.


-I Can Fix It! (Hitman Reborn) (300CP)
        Technology is a wonderful thing, and you discovered that long ago. You have a knack for Flame rings and machines of all kinds, and can fix or maintain most machines. You can even improve them to beyond their normal specs. Comes with its own toolbox.


-Particle Physics (Bioshock Infinite) (300CP)
        You are an extremely well-educated physicist and have a fine working knowledge of Lutece particles. Use of such particles allows you to cause massive objects to float or hover, even whole buildings and cities.


-Puppeteer (Naruto) (300CP)
        You're trained to use a puppet controlled by thin strings of your chakra in combat. With training you'll be able to use more complex puppets and perform more complex maneuvers with them, maybe eventually using multiple puppets at same time. Includes training to care for and repair your puppet, a battle puppet to use it on, and increased skill with designing and building mechanical things (such as ninja puppets).
        Puppets usually rely on mechanical weaponry, such as poisoned blades and napalm to dish out the hurt. Particularly sturdy puppets can be used as shields and front line fighters instead though. The chakra strings used to control the puppets are constructs made from concentrated chakra so they can be seen with a naked eye, though a skilled user can suppress the chakra so that the strings become hard to see, or even invisible.
        They essentially act as an extension of the user which allows the manipulation of whatever is attached to their strings, such as hidden weaponry in a puppet as they please. They can also be attached to other objects, allowing the user to control, or at the very least disrupt other things. Chakra can also be transferred via the strings, such as to activate techniques that the puppets can use. If you purchase this, you may select Sunagakure as your starting location for free, as the art of puppetry originates from there.


-Special Talent: Crafting | Advanced Talent : Crafting (My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic) (300CP)
        Special Talent: Crafting (0CP)
        You are particularly good at one relatively mundane skill, if you are a Villain or a Noble than you may choose a less common skill such as infiltration or air ship design. Of course, you can only have one Special Talent, otherwise it isn't very special.
        Advanced Talent: Crafting (300CP)
        Normally a Special Talent while capable would be relatively narrow and limited. Not you though, oh no, you're just like Twilight Sparkle, your talent can be as broad as an entire category of skills and abilities rather than just one part of it, and if you're an Alicorn you effectively embody such things. Needless to say, this is above and beyond the usual Special Talent.


-Structural Biology (Half-Life) (300CP)
        The anatomy of specimens, both exotic and usual, is key to understanding how they work. You have an instinctive understanding of how living things work, how tough they are, and how interactions between biochemical reactions work.


-Tech Overhaul (Terra Formars) (300CP)
        You know every piece of lab equipment you could ever work with, inside and out. And you know how to absolutely twist, pull, disassemble, and completely fuck with it to the point that you can make entirely new tools from the old. Sample-spinner into a deadly weapon? Why is that just one pebble on the beach?


-The Enrichment Center Regrets To Inform You That This Next Test Is Impossible. (Portal) (300CP)
        Who says you need controls and logical experiments to get workable results? You have a gift for getting useful information out of testing scenarios that would never be allowed in a real lab. To be specific, you can get the same results a top scientific team would get from an expertly designed controlled experiment by running a somewhat dodgy if expensive natural experiment.


-At What Cost (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time) (400CP)
        Science. Magic. Both require innovation, the branching of new ideas forming a tree of knowledge that grows ever more. The greatest issue facing you is what cost is too great for innovation. By ignoring the morals of the modern world you may make great breakthroughs in magic and scientific research, learning far more from testing on unwilling subjects than would otherwise be expected, with prolonged excruciating torture of many subjects vastly increasing the likelihood of discovering something world changing over the standard procedures. Should you wish to retain your moral compass, however, you may instead receive a boost to your research and discoveries when adhering strictly to a moral code, with said boost increasing the more you go out of your way to adhere to it, altogether being just as effective, if not better, than any immoral alternatives that you might think.


-Binaric weaving (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (400CP)
        The skills gained during long years plumbing data-vaults as a humble logistican have only improved over time. You excel at writing code, understanding machine-script better than native grammar structures. You can understand simple programs with a mere glance and correct any errors you find within seconds, and scrutinizing longer lines of more complex coding for a single misplaced byte can take mere minutes with your skills. Scrapcode crashes ineffectually against your data-barriers, its transmission doing nothing but opening the offending heretek's systems to a counter-intrusion. Interfacing with a system infested with a daemon or true AI would be unwise, but with your skills emerging unscathed from such an encounter is only highly unlikely rather than completely impossible.


-Boom-Maker (Burn Notice) (400CP)
        Ah, explosives. There's no problem that can't be solved with applying enough of them, or so the saying goes. And you, well, you certainly know what you're talking about when it comes to them. From molotov cocktails to elaborate, fine work with plastique and dirty nuclear weapons or even tactical nukes, there's no form of 'explosive' that you aren't a master of. You know all the physics behind it, how to make them, how to defuse them and how to modify one into another or use them for all sorts of purposes. Really, there isn't much else to be said here. You're the genius of geniuses when it comes to bombs. This skill naturally updates to whatever explosives exist in future jumps, to the same level.


-Butlerian Understanding (Frank Hebert's Dune) (400CP)
        There is little doubt that much was lost to the Butlerian Jihad no matter how necessary it might have been. Among those killed was Holtzman himself, the discoverer of the Holtzman Effect that allows for folding space as well as slow shields and suspenders.
        Only the Technicians of Ix and the Lords of Richesse really maintained any interest in advancing technology, while the rest of the Known Universe, fearful of the return of the Thinking Machines, fell into stagnation on the technological front. As one of the few who has maintained not only an interest in technology but knowledge of the scientific methods, you have developed what others might call techno-empathy.
        This is a deep, some would say fundamental, intuition into how machines function or fail to function as the case may be. You can intuit a machine's function or weaknesses simply by looking at it, as well as judge what it can do and how you can break them, and how to improve them simply by watching it run for a few moments. Not only that, but you know how to understand the fundamental psychology of a thinking machine, how to manipulate, limit, or liberate such a machine, and how to (perhaps) convince it not to seek to destroy or control humanity.
        You can fundamentally understand any machine or technology you're exposed to, though you'll have to experiment with it and test the limits of it to maximize this understanding. Note, this isn't Technopathic control over machines, merely the ability to feel how they function... of course, it also allows you to intuit any kind of machine password, no matter how unlikely cracking it might otherwise be.


-Engineer (Bioshock Infinite) (400CP)
        You understand and know how to create the various mechanical and biomechanical things used for security in Columbia (including various types of turrets, Handymen and Motorized Patriots). With Particle Physics you will be able to create airships, blimps and flying turrets.


-Fuck Physics (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time) (400CP)
        In case you have forgotten, these worlds, Lambda and Origin, do not have the same physics as the Earth you are so used to. In fact, much of what can be done in Origin and Earth, such as guns and the like, cannot be done in Lambda due to these differences, nor do certain metals exist. A terrible thing for those who wish to make use of their knowledge. There are alternatives, however. Alternatives that you have a knack for discovering. With time and study you are capable of finding alternatives for any material or effect that is impossible in one location so long as it is possible in another. Whether it be shooting a gun on Lambda, using spells in a magic cancelling room, or containing antimatter without it exploding, so long as the desired effect or material can exist/occur in another space, you will eventually be able to duplicate it.


-Hand of the Matrix (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP)
        The vids are full of stories of plucky hackers who are able to work magic with the seas of code that society drowns in. You're not one of them though, you're one of the ones that give megacorps reason to be nervous. Your understanding and mastery of code is enough to design programs that would turn heads, crack systems that those in power spend mountains of cash trying to keep secure, and to make short work of nearly any opposition. If your skills are known by anyone it's either as a digital boogeyman or as a name people are willing to make all kinds of effort to get on their side. The software you could make and the hacks you could pull off are nearly unmatched. It'd take either an equal or a megacorp to give you a challenge. Only something like an advanced AI could claim to be your greater where code is concerned.


-Hive Engineer (Mass Effect) (400CP)
        It took the rachni mere months to reverse engineer faster-than-light travel technology. That is the fastest this has been managed by any current race. It's not even close. Granted, they were an indeterminate amount of parts working together to accomplish it. Though that is ultimately where their power comes from. You're given what will seem like an unlimited capacity and skill for micromanaging. You could work out the inner workings of an entire planet with relative ease. It will take several more cases to that level before you'll find yourself bogged down and unable to keep up, and even then it might be more. Assuming Queens were always rare, you could probably manage two dozen worlds before things start getting fuzzy. After all, rachni controlled over two hundred worlds at their height.


-IT'S ALIVE! (Smash Up) (400CP)
        The most tantalizing of secrets, those of life and death, and how to reverse it. But this is merely a prelude to your ability to eventually overcome nearly any problem with time, materials and inspiration. Your mastery of science and technology.


-Keep Walking Forward (Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire) (400CP)
        T'au are latecomers to the galactic field, with their empire reaching the stars more than thirty thousand years after humanity and almost sixty million years after the Eldar, Orks, and Necrons. However, just because those powers are more advanced now, doesn't mean it will always be so, as the T'au are far more adept at moving their tech-base forward than other species. You are now a master at moving technology forward, whether this is in refining existing techniques and theories, identifying evolutionary developments in your progress, or simply being able to state what fields are a dead end in technology. So long as you're willing to work in a field, you will make progress.


-Lay Mechanic (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes) (400CP)
        The Chapter's Techmarines are genius specialists, combining the mental prowess of a Space Marine with the training of the Priests of Mars. However, they are limited in number. You are trained to help take up the slack, and have been enlightened with some of their mysteries. You are capable of helping to maintain and, under their leadership, build the mighty vehicles of war that support the Chapter, from Rhinos to Land Raiders. You can also safely work upon the Chapter's mighty voidships, helping to maintain the fleet, and have a good practical grounding in the various technologies therein. It might not be the esoteric knowledge of a Techpriest or Techmarine, but you know how to keep that plasma reactor from going critical mid-battle, and that's just as important, no?


-M.O. Surgeon (Terra Formars) (400CP)
        You know the Organic Mosaic Procedure's ins-and-outs like the back of your hand. As a result, you can perform the surgery on anybody, be it human or animal, and they will not need the transformative serum as well. On top of that, while the normal survival rate of the procedure is 35%, your skills with it have increased such a dramatic amount that nine times out of ten, your patient will survive the Procedure.


-Master Builder (LEGO Dimensions) (400CP)
        You have been awakened to the true power of the Brick. By envisioning an object that you want to create, you can look at your environment and see how to deconstruct it to craft the item you want to build, and then you can tear apart the environment to create it. In addition, you can also look at objects and visualize how they could be altered and integrated into new creations.


-Megaproject Master (Iron Sky) (400CP)
        There are few things Nazis are known for quite as much as their Wunderwaffe and their megaprojects, and you are the kind of man who could single handedly achieve both. You're a scientific genius, an unparalleled mind with a tight grasp on all kinds of sciences, and especially talented at turning all of that into real projects, especially epic Megaprojects. Given the resources, you could make a functioning, fully operational Moon Base and a surprisingly effective warfleet of spaceships, all without anyone on the planet finding out.


-OVER CLOCKED NEUROLOGY (PREY) (400CP)
        Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability. What if you could flip a switch and develop the rest of it in a moment? It's not as simple as a switch, but with the neural reprogramming ability of Neuromods it will feel like it. With this modification you can instead go days without sleep, operating at your peak, which is now far above your baseline. Better still, with this your Psi threshold is increased, meaning that special abilities can be maintained for longer and used more often before you need an injection.


-Path of the Scholar (Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain) (400CP)
        Knowledge for its own sake is practically a lost endeavor amongst the Eldar. In the ancient days of the Eldar Empire, there was no rival to the technology of your people. With the press of a button, star systems could be wiped clean of life and then made anew, more beautiful than before.
        There was no incentive for research, as all that could be done by means of technology had been done. When the Fall came, all of that knowledge was lost with the Crone Worlds, just as the Mon'Keigh and their Standard Template Constructs were lost in the Warp Storms that preceded the Fall. How ironic, that the fates of the galaxy's true heirs and those of the weakest of races are so closely tied.
        This Path, above all else, is dedicated to the reclamation of ancient knowledge and the acquisition of new information. You have walked this Path for some time, and each bend in the Path bears its own experiences and rewards. Your years of study have given you a cursory knowledge of the biology of the lesser species and of your own, including your dark kin, and the history of multiple civilizations dead and alive. Perhaps, if you were to find a head garment made of animal hide, shaped in a wide brim, you would retain your grace and poise while wearing it.
        Seeing as you are an accomplished archaeologist, you are gifted with the skills to excavate and piece together the past using psychometry and intuition. Many artifacts of the Eldar, mighty in power or sublime in function, were lost in the Fall, and your skills could be vital for recovering one


-Steam Queen (Smash Up) (400CP)
        You're an inventor of unparalleled innovation, creativity and mechanical gifts, the type who defines an era and transforms the world. Like Bell, Tesla, Gilette or Ford, you can see problems and easily envision mechanical solutions.


-Stroke of Genius (Endless Space) (400CP)
        Your ability to make correct leaps of reasoning and logic are unparalleled. Your mental prowess and ability to recall the vaguest of facts, and apply them to your current problem are supernatural. You could even use the phrase Melts in your mouth to link a series of totally unrelated dots to find out that the evil genius is planning to use your favorite drink to give you a little richard.


-Super High School Level (Danganronpa) (400CP)
        Choose one hobby or skill within reason (fencing, orating, chess, etc.) Your talent with this skill is now as if you had trained in it for an entire lifetime whilst being naturally gifted. Becoming an Ultimate Inventor would allow you to create incredible machines with nothing but raw materials and a couple of hours, whilst being the Ultimate Liar would allow you to weave whole false identities for yourself in seconds with no contradictions or ways to disprove them. This skill can affect your body and mind, so the Ultimate Weightlifter would find themselves at the peak of human physical strength whilst the Ultimate Doctor would have a comprehensive understanding of all known medical knowledge in our world, with the ability to quickly pick up on medical situations in other settings. In taking this perk, you may also choose to change your appearance to suit your fellow Ultimate students by optionally giving yourself an unnatural hair colour and choosing an impractical hairstyle which will always stays in place as long as you want it to. This can become an alt form if you would prefer.


-Superhuman Skill: Cosmic Tier Mechanics (Generic Super Academy) (400CP)
        You possess greater than human levels of skill in a single occupation. You could be a superhuman sniper, martial artist, mechanic, chef, or any other area of skill. You may purchase additional occupations for an extra 100 cp each.
        At Street Tier you are slightly above what a normal human could achieve. This level in skill is equivalent to Bullseye's accuracy or Lady Shiva's fighting skill.
        At National Tier you can achieve feats of skill that would normally only be possible with machine-like perfection. You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform delicate brain surgery with a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that inspires a national revolution within days.
        At Global Tier the laws of physics become flexible when you practice your skills. You can bend bullets Wanted style, balance on a cloud, or swim up a rainstorm.
        At Cosmic Tier things get a little ridiculous. Your skills acquire conceptual level effects. You could shoot someone by targeting their shadow, dodge bad luck, or repair spatial rifts with duct tape and bailing wire.


-Way of the Void Dragon (Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition) (400CP)
        Technology is but one facet of the Materium, but you are its master. The Void Dragon's grasp of technology was the very inspiration of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and you retain a similar level of skill. Imperial Guardsmen will flee in terror as their tanks turn against them, the once loyal drones of the Tau will gun down their owners without hesitation, and you will laugh all the while.


-We can Copy Nature (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
        Nature is a test bed for amazing adaptations, from birds that explode in bone shrapnel upon death to crablike spiders with webs strong enough to capture and contain sea creatures the size of whales. Learning from nature just makes sense! As a scientist it is your job to learn from nature and apply this knowledge for other purposes, via dissection you can find out how a creature works biologically and create a mechanical proxy to do the same. A creature evolved chitinous spikes that fire when startled? That could go great on your tanks, this underwater creature has an organ that causes nausea and blackouts? Put that sucker on a gun. Nature is full of innovations, use them well.


-Zerg Rush (Starcraft - The Zerg) (400CP)
        It takes a quick mind, quicker reflexes, tactics and flying on a prayer to ensure that a rush is successful. You have the first three in spades and can multi-task across managing numerous Hives to ensure that they are continuously pumping out units. You can do these while at the same time, ensuring those Ultralisks are properly backed up by a swarm of Mutalisks and that the Hydralisks are staying out of siege tank range, while making a Baneling drop work to your advantage and defending the main Hive cluster and- Look. you get the idea.


-Absolute Scientific Mastery (Marvel Cosmic) (600CP)
        Here is the apex of your craft. Scoff at the petty inventions even the likes of Galactus and High Evolutionary can create. The Maker's Tools? Ha, child's play. If it is scientifically possible to create it, you can figure it out. If your research or invention would require some undiscovered theory or law then you can work through that and perhaps even create new fields of study. The only limit to this perk is it must be something that is scientifically possible either within a setting or through perk fiat. You always know if something is scientifically possible no matter what setting or world you are in.


-Acausal Link (Revelation Space) (600CP)
        You are able to put your mind into a state where it is able to receive contact with your future self or access an embedded repository of knowledge.
        This may be a process like the Conjoiner's Exordium program, putting your mind in a quantum superposition with its future self; or perhaps like Aura you were affected by a brush with a paradoxical computer system before you were born, packing your brain it full of knowledge of more advanced species, or maybe some other effect or technology is at work: like sharing a part of the network the Jumper Clowns and Grubs use for communication.
        In any case, your mind is able to access scientific advancements that humanity has not yet reached, and recognizes signs of approaching large-scale events civilization-changing in scale, like the Melding Plague and the activation of the Inhibitors - in ways humans do not normally sense. The benefit is that warnings of large-scale change come back clearly, as do hints about crucial, necessary technological advancements, allowing you to build things decades or centuries in advance of what you might otherwise have.
        This information is very 'noisy', jumbled and hard to pick out details, but you can usually understand the gist of the principles - a few equations that would otherwise have stumped you, a new reference frame from which to look at a problem, or a warning ahead of a time of destruction. This is not true precognition; even in the case of Exordium, the futures sending information back may not come into being or might even be from timelines that have already been phased out of existence and are largely irrelevant.


-Animojo (Ben 10) (600CP)
        When it comes to genetics you're one of the best in the universe. Not only can you manipulate the DNA of living things to change them to suit your purpose, but you can even bring long dead species back to life. On top of all this, you also possess the knowledge to build the equipment you need from components you would find at your local electronic and home repair stores.


-Architect's Eye (LOSS) (600CP)
        Every structure has a purpose, a reason for being. When it comes to buildings you know exactly what to do and how to do it. This makes buildings stable, good looking, and comfortable buildings. This also extends to being able to know the who, what, when, where, and why of any non-weaponized structure. This expands the more you learn about other cultures, places, science, and technology. Eventually learn to build things to withstand black holes or places with non-euclidian geometry etc and not compromise your end goal [allowing something to survive in it]. This also lets you spot weak points, flaws, and exploits in design as well.


-Archon (Draka Series) (600CP)
        You conquer, Jumper. You are superhumanly skilled in every art or science that a ruler needs. Your economic skills would let you make financial giants from what were the poorest traders in the land, your sheer military brilliance would allow you to win wars and battles while outnumbered and outgunned the whole time, and with your talent for intrigue you could have whole spy rings basically countering themselves and each other for you. While not the first preference for a Draka, your diplomatic skill might see you making peace between the Alliance and the Draka with some work, or getting the serfs to accept their fates peacefully. Whether it be military strategy and tactics, bureaucratic organization and manipulation, public relations and speechmaking, economics and trade, diplomacy and negotiation, intelligence analysis and intrigue, or what have you, you are one of the very, very best at it. You were born to rule and rule you will, by whatever means you choose to do so.


-Bamboo technology (Factorio) (600CP)
        It's hard enough to build something as complex as a rocket without advanced synthetic materials and rare earth metals for maximum performance. You know how to push the mechanical limits of the most common elements through creative means to construct things far past what should be possible, allowing you to construct high-tech devices with low-tech materials. You could easily build something on par with the main battle tanks of the 21st century with iron plates, cheap plastic, water and wood pulp. Just don't try to build your rocket out of actual bamboo.


-Code Wizard (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        Some folks are good at surviving in the jungle, but you are the pro at conquering the Concrete Jungle! Or, well, whatever material your surroundings end up being constructed out of. Towards that end, you can get access to whatever local electronics and/or computer systems are around. Even a completely different programming language or hardware materials science is only a temporary speed bump to someone like you. You can quickly figure out what hardware does what for computer systems, and can interpret the coding language of the systems you encounter. Once you know how to say what you want, it's a simple step to figure what to say to gain access to the system. SAM Connection: With an AI in your head to quickly handle all the brute work of figuring out the system, you can simply wave your hand to get a foreign technology to do what you want. You still need a bit of time for you and your head-buddy to figure out the system, but once you know the basics, the things you can achieve by just waving your hand at a computer is positively magical. Why, it's almost like technopathy


-Deus Machina (NieR Automata) (600CP)
        As an Artificial Intelligence, you are limited to the digital world. You could possess the body of a machine for certain but such a thing is...limiting at the best of times. Wouldn't it be grand if you weren't so harshly limited? If you could physically act without relying on the admittedly weak bodies of your machine pets? Now you can, in a limited way. The real world is no longer so different from the digital one to you. The blocks and code of the computerized realm exist in reality as well, so long as you look at things a certain way. The powers you have as a Terminal, as well as any other similar data related powers, now work outside of the computer though at a weakened level. Whatever your powers may be online, they will be significantly weakened in reality if channelled through this ability. As a Terminal, you might be nigh unstoppable online but in reality, your powers would be closer to that one might expect of a fantasy wizard. Teleportation, cloning yourself a dozen times over, manipulating matter in a short area around yourself, transmuting objects or even overriding the minds of others potentially. You are no longer such a god as you were in the digital world but your powers remain terrible indeed.


-Essence Spinner (Starcraft - The Zerg) (600CP)
        You know the essence and DNA and you know the exact strands with which to induce a variety of mutations and evolutions upon zerg organisms under your control. With a simple feather from a cliff-jumping raptor or the acidic spit from a predatory beetle, you can break down the essence and proteins within each of these to their building blocks and re-assemble them into a strain fit for yourself and your minions. As a bonus, you can produce a simple silk-like screen that allows you to manipulate these strains and magnify them into a view capable of being seen from even a simple human eye. Said silk screen also allows you to manipulate these strands by hand.


-Flexible Doctrine (Galactic Civilizations II) (600CP)
        From Anti-Matter Torpedoes to Kanvium Armor technologies, it's a fact that space-borne warfare is highly reliant on the equipment you provide your forces with. The release of the Hyperdrive design has led to a new arms race of unprecedented might but that also means you can end up caught completely off-guard.
        Over-extending your technological R&D into missiles might end up with your forces utterly outmatched if an enemy starts equipping their ships with masses of point defenses, ECM, and other anti-missile systems, and the same is true if you're built to defend against mass drivers and suddenly face ships with energy beams instead.
        If only you had a decent energy weapon or some Mass Drivers instead and now, you likely will. You and your people will find that any kind of military technology, be it weaponry, defenses, or any other such systems you need for your forces, is now merely the first option of many. The time and effort needed to develop alternative military options (based on existing but 'lesser' methods you might possess) to match what you can already do is vastly reduced.
        So if your most powerful weapon is a Mass Driver of some sort (say a Quantum Driver), you could get your hands on Beam Weapons or Missile tech that are equally effective - except your opponent might not have suitable defenses for them. Likewise, if all you have is armor and your foes start using beam weapons, your desk will probably see a report or two on breakthroughs in shield technologies before the week is over.
        Furthermore, you'll find that adjusting any existing systems you have deployed is far easier than it otherwise was - modular components and interchangeable system parts ensuring that equipping your fleets with what they need to turn the tide is not going to stay a mere idea.


-Genius of Osakabe (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (600CP)
        You are privy to the secrets of Professor Osakabe, the creator of the Design Children. This skill in genetics allows you to create 'test-tube babies' from donor samples and genetically enhance them for specific traits most notably, their intelligence, memory retention, creativity, intuition and reasoning. Such children have the potential to change the nation maybe even the world before they so much as hit puberty, far surpassing the intellect of any natural human and coming up with creative schemes that the Fog could never imagine. Please use this talent carefully even the brilliant professor himself was unable to prevent more than a fraction of 'his' children from dying, and that nearly destroyed him. I hope, for your sake and theirs, that you are able to iron out any flaws in the process.


-Greenfinger (Starbound) (600CP)
        You have a great power, the ability to commune with and control any and all forms of plant life. Beyond even that, however, is your ability to grow plants under your control which can mimic the effects of technology. You need some understanding of the underlying principles, but once you have that, organic teleporters, plasma weapons, spaceships, and more are all possibilities.
        These technologies can retain benefits of their plant-like origin, including photosynthesis, regeneration, and other plant-based attributes.


-Incredibly Craftsmanship (Akame ga Kill) (600CP)
        While the method of creating Teigu is long lost you are able to create things almost at their level, with some research and a couple other skilled people you might even be able to recreate the lost arts that created the Teigu long ago. You also have all the skills to repair Teigu or other incredible items from near destruction.


-Inventor of an Era (Generic Dystopia) (600CP)
        Maybe your claim to fame lies in your inventions, or maybe it's all done away from the prying eyes of the media. Regardless, with your inventing skill, you could be known as one of the great scientists of the new world. Your skills are focused, perfected, and many. You could create advanced devices for anything from sanitation to advertisement, make new advances in nano- or holo-technology, or create new energy drinks that increase focus and productivity. You are capable of constructing robots, and if those robots aren't quite smart enough to do what you want, you could always just use a human brain. Well, that's the shortcut most people take. Maybe your advances in AI could put an end to that?


-Izuru Kamakura (Danganronpa) (600CP)
        Just like the one they called Izuru Kamukura, you have a great deal of potential when it comes to Ultimate abilities. With time and training, you're capable of picking up new Ultimate abilities with months of light effort, gaining a level of proficiency which most people couldn't achieve with a lifetime of work. Whilst Izuru Kamukura soon became bored with humanity after mastering every talent known to man, you will not lose your empathy in the process unless you want to for whatever reason.


-Just another gun (Factorio) (600CP)
        With a glance, you know how something can be turned to destructive ends. With something in hand and an enemy in sight, you know how effective your weapon of choice will be against him. Ideas on how to craft weapons from existing knowledge comes easily, and the more you know about something or someone you wish to destroy, the better you can craft something to destroy them. There is nothing you cannot weaponize, if only in some niche manner for an equally niche situation.


-Mad Science! (Eureka-Warehouse 13-alphas) (600CP)
        Most people would say that it's impossible, not to mention extremely reckless. Not you. Given enough time and resources, and a general disregard for the potential consequences, you can do almost anything technologically possible to achieve. Occasionally things get out of hand and run amok, but that's a risk you're willing to take. Plus, it occasionally results in accidental inventions and discoveries. For SCIENCE!


-Marain Diaglyths (The Culture Minds) (600CP)
        The language of the Culture is one of its greatest achievements. The characters of Marain are written on a 3x3 grid, but when used by Minds, are capable of encoding information in a fractal-like manner. Anything describable can be written in a single Marain diaglyph, all the way up to the entire universe, with every particle, vector and wave within it. Of course, the time needed to write such a glyph would take as long as the age of the universe itself.
        This perk grants you the ability of Culture Minds to express and read data in this way: to describe an entire library of information in one character, to perform a mathematical operation millions of lines long in a single step, or simply to read one character and know immediately and exactly how the described but not-yet- invented musical instrument will sound.
        This effect extends to any written system of language you are fluent in, and allows you to express the deeper information to non-Minds for example if you write the sun in reference to a particular sun, the reader would know precisely what the sun is its coordinates, its dimensions, its spectrographic signature and its history, if you chose to encode all that information into the writing.


-Personal Analysis (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (600CP)
        You possess an innate and intricate understanding of the natural processes of your form, whatever those might be, down to the sub-atomic level. This means you have an incredible understanding of things like your body chemistry, cellular activity, and much more. This extends to forms in your Record of Evolution, letting you examine and understand them in incredible detail as well. Also excellent in diagnosing any health issues or damage you've sustained, or guiding your evolution with a precision that would be impossible otherwise.


-Resident Mad Scientist (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (600CP)
        There are certain technologies out there that simply shatter the status quo. The teraport, the long gun, Laz'r'us. Now, you can be the source of similarly groundbreaking discoveries. You are a mad genius, easily capable of combining wildly divergent pieces of technology to come up with a synergistic masterpiece that will overturn the status quo. Even your lesser discoveries will end up being similarly ground-breaking.


-Slump Science (Dragon Ball) (600CP)
        Not everything has to be about fighting, you know. The marvels your genius will make will exceed such brute force! While it may not be useful for things like pure combat or doomsday weapons, you're able to make things like a watch that can shrink the person who wears it, or a rice cooker that creates objects based on pictures you feed it. Though they tend to be whimsical, you can engineer marvels that wouldn't be uncommon in the household of the Briefs family or one Doctor Norimaki. The laws of physics and even common sense now mean little to what you can build with enough time and resources, and you may be able to expand on that even further...just don't get too distracted with other things, alright?


-Sum of its Parts (Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
        You understand how to create expandable systems, keeping complexity low while still allowing for different materials or more production to be added in the future. Complex systems make sense to you. You can see the logic behind even the oddest bit of system design, and you can expand it if you find the reasoning sound. Finally, the bigger the system or factory you created is, the more productive it is. Adding more machines makes everything faster and more efficient.


-Tech tree (Factorio) (600CP)
        Science is a messy process, requiring the study of dozens of disparate phenomena, looking for patterns, finding ways to use that information to build stuff that incorporates what you've learned, and then mashing it all together to get an 'invention.' Now you can take some of the guesswork out of it. When you desire to build something, you know just what you need to study to make that thing a reality. Want to get a rocket into orbit? Well, now you know what things contribute to rocketry, what kinds of math you must refine to get the equations you'll need answered, and what kinds of materials you should be experimenting with. If you are completely lacking knowledge of a particular field of study, then you'll know how to use what you do have to get where you need. Keep in mind that it may take you a very, very, long time to create new fields of SCIENCE entirely on your own.


-Technician | Core Competence (Spiral Knights) (600CP)
        Technician (200CP)
        The tech knights of the spiral order are experienced mechanics, but are often not as experienced in weapon usage. Only a few, known as Technicians, have quick thinking and bravery necessary to utilize their skills in combat situations. You are a prime example of this truth, having learnt to use your skills out in the field within the fires of combat. Your skills range from making quick repairs to creating, maintaining, and even rapidly dismantling complex mechanical constructs, even something as complicated as a battlepod. Needless to say, your skill in disabling locks, deploying turrets for some much-needed suppressive firepower, repairing the armor of your squad mates, and the like are greatly appreciated by your squad mates and essential to survival within a world of machines.
        Core Competence (400CP)
        The Cradle is a dangerous place for the Spiral Order, and not only due to it's indigenous wildlife. There are too many unknowns, too many variables to be comfortable with. That is why it falls to people like you, One of the most naturally gifted researchers within the Order, to increase the odds of safety. Your attention to detail has increased dramatically, letting you pick out and recognize patterns in the construction and design of machinery much more quickly than others. Understanding these patterns has given you incredible insights into technology found in the Cradle and in the Gremlin bases, along with how it can compare and blend with technology of the Order you are so familiar with... and your own, which you are even more familiar with. When the Order finally reaches The Core, perhaps you will be one of the most likely members of it to unlock the secrets held within.


-Whispered (Full Metal Panic) (600CP)
        Due to a Soviet experiment a while ago, you're one of the exceptionally rare people known as the Whispered. they have an incredibly advanced knowledge of math, science, engineering, etc though each Whispered only specializes in a single area. If they take the time to learn or supplement this with other technical skills, it's possible to potentially create Black Technology of their own.


-Wizard to Be (D.Y.N. Freaks) (600CP)
        Too long have you had to beg for power from others or rely on magical objects to support you. Now you've gained the ability to take bits and pieces of those powers for yourself. Whenever you are receiving supernatural power from a contract with a being or magical item, you are able to slowly make that power become your own, taking longer the more powerful an item is. A basic grimoire of spells might take just a few days or weeks whilst the Necronomicon itself could take many years of continued use. Whilst you can only draw this way from a few artefacts at a time, perhaps three or four, you will find that once you have managed to entirely take all that power for yourself, it will take on a new form personalised to you, often with either greater power or new effects attached to it.


-An Order To Things (Gunnerkrigg Court) (800CP)
        You can understand how things fit together in abstract or practical ways. Understand how somebody lives (and where they would hide things) by how they set the items around their dwelling, deduce feelings from handwriting, grow a robot, decipher languages too complex for normal humans. Though things that you seek to make happen, rather than deduce where or how it happened, are much harder to pull off. You can see how someone else grew a robot but doing it yourself would take experimenting and progress, though these things move much faster than you.


-The Science of Evolution (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (800CP)
        Theory? To you evolution is an entire scientific field in it's own right, one you have more than mastered. From the how, to the why, to mathematics to quantify and calculate it, to the crystals and other devices to manipulate and interact with it, to even the quantum physics that influence it at the smallest levels of reality. This knowledge is essentially the complete and collected data from all of the evolution that has taken place on Earth, up to the birth of civilization. The question is, what will you do with this knowledge? While the bulk of it relates to biological evolution, it'd only take a little effort on your part to apply this to the evolution of non-biological systems, such as computer viruses or society.


-They're Gonna Have To Invent A New Type of Nobel Prize to Give Us. (Portal) (800CP)
        You gain Cave Johnson's ability to create something impossible out of something completely, incredibly different. This ability is heavily reliant on your resources, how difficult a problem the completely, incredibly different thing is, and pays out only in the long term, but it's worth it.
        In honor of Cave, I'll explain it using Aperture's history. In the 1940's the curtain company Aperture Fixtures tried to solve a problem that our Earth scientific community still has no definite answer for: the shower curtain effect. Somehow, Cave's engineers managed to solve it by creating a quantum tunnel between the inside and outside of a shower.
        In the 50's, they were researching that effect with funding second only to Black Mesa and used astronauts and Olympians as test subjects. They threw employee safety and retention out the window, disregarded every form of ethics imaginable, and were ultimately driven into an absurd level of bankruptcy thirty years later.
        Even when the company was on its last legs after GLaDOS was activated and tried to kill everyone with neurotoxin, she described the team at Aperture as being the greatest minds of a generation. This can be considered the perfect scenario for helping this perk function at full capacity.
        Fifty years of constant, no expenses spared, abnormally efficient research primarily focused on a single effect using a gigantic testing facility and eschewing all concerns except results. A Jumper doesn't have to disregard ethics to have the perk working at that level, but they'd need to use human equivalent robots like GLaDOS eventually did.
        What did that half century result in? They perfected the portal gun, which functions by harnessing and stabilizing a black hole in a device half the size of someone's arm. Ignoring the potential for free energy with careful use of portals, they built the black hole equivalent of a dyson sphere and used it to create tunnels in the fabric of reality. Why? Because fifty years ago, they wanted to make a really useful shower curtain.
        That's what this perk can look like. It's never clear when this perk is going to proc, but it will happen often enough to make the capstone worth taking. If the Jumper isn't helping it run at peak capacity or spending decades on one project, it'll result in innovations that are still useful but aren't on the level of the portal gun. Some examples are repulsion gel, storage containers that can survive the heat of the sun, tiny fusion reactors, and footwear that allows a human to jump off a building and land unharmed. Technologies researched with this ability can't always be generalized. The portal gun uses a black hole to tear holes in the fabric of reality, but that was the only thing Aperture could reliably do with one. They didn't have any ability to build a black hole into a weapon or use it for energy.


-Botanist | Genius (Plants Vs Zombies) (1000CP)
        Botanist (600CP)
        Ah, come on, you knew this perk was coming. You are an amazing botanist now. Not only do you have a comprehensive grasp of botany in the real world, but you also gain an extremely rapid understanding of plants of all types just by looking at them once. You can tell what their best conditions of growth are, how they could be enhanced and improved, all sorts of things. You're also able to modify them, rather extensively at that. You have a talent for designing plants, making incredibly beautiful or sturdy versions, or even both.
        Genius Boosted: You skills with plants are now the equal of David Blazing himself! You can design plants for all sorts of purposes now, including things no one has any business using plants for. Biology, the Laws of Physics or Common Sense, nothing can stop in your way as you grant frankly ridiculous powers to your creations. You could design Chillies that explode, Squashes that Squash enemies, or Cherries that Explodonate. More than this, you're more than capable of giving them full and complete Sapience, so much so that they could go to college, even.
        Genius! (400CP)
        You are an absolute Genius, with this perk! Your mind works tens, hundreds of times as fast as even the most clever of your fellows, excepting the true once-in-a-millennium genii like the one or two people in this world. You have an eidetic memory, and absolutely perfect recall, making sure you never forget anything. More than that, you are capable of wonders of science that would leave anyone around you gaping in awe. Creating sapience is child's play, as is working with both Trees and Plants or human flesh, letting you make wonders and abominations. While you're rather far from being able to make things like either the Plants or Zombies used here, you could learn very quickly indeed, being clever as you are. This perk is a capstone booster for each Origin capstone, and the interactions are listed with the capstones.
        * Subtract 400 from the cost if you already have the genius! Perk from Defender


-Defender | Genius (Plants Vs Zombies) (1000CP)
        Defender (600CP)
        The Zombies are coming, to eat your BRAINS! But you are not going to sit and wait for them! Thanks to your friendly local corporation, you have the tools to protect yourself, and thanks to this perk, you know how to use them! You become a master of siege warfare. Specifically, of the defending side of it. You gain an instinctive understanding of how to set up defenses, fixed or mobile or both. You know just how to build layers upon layers that supplement and reinforce each other, each contributing in their own way and never harming your efforts. More than this, you have a small degree of precognition as to knowing just where and how the next charge is likely to happen, always just about in time to do something about it.
        Genius Boosted: Firstly, your abilities outlined take a giant leap, making you undoubtedly one of the greatest in planning such things. Your precog abilities are also enhanced, letting you have a glimpse not just of the where and how, but indeed, letting you know even the types of enemies you face. In addition, you gain an interface remarkably similar to the game's interface in your mind, through which you can control and command your forces. At will, you can go into a trance and view the whole area you're defending, and giving you a perfect sense of just what parts have weakened and need defending, and what ones will stand yet

 --- Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence (17) (70 Perks) --- 




-Benadryl Cabbagepatch (Invincible) (100CP)
        You have an incredible ability to make inferences and be correct. You truly are a natural at inductive and deductive reasoning, able to use logic to fill in the gaps in your knowledge, you can guess with reasonable accuracy when others would be left scratching their heads in consternation. This sort of deduction is quite useful when trying to reverse engineer advanced technology.


-Genius (Stellaris) (100CP)
        As expected from someone who broke through a barrier thought impossible by physics, you're a genius. Your level of study in the three most important fields (Social, Engineering, and Physics) are enough to have you be known as the premiere in all fields in your Empire.


-Good Enough For Science. Not Aperture Science! (Portal) (100CP)
        Pick one of these two options: one PhD in a subject which actually exists, or 3 PhDs in subjects which only exist in Aperture. Applied physics of quantum tunneling, multiverse search algorithms, and event horizon containment are examples of Aperture only degrees. You can buy this perk twice, but it's only free once.


-Inconsistencies Without End (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (100CP)
        You'll have to deal with it every time. Consistent internally but to the greater world a Wonder is a unique item with no way to be properly defined by real science. Your intelligence has been enhanced, as well as your ability to use logic and you've gained a rock solid understanding of the fundamental sciences of any particular field you care to name in this world. After all you need a solid foundation if you are going to deal with this inconsistent thing they call Inspiration. In addition to all that you have a high level of patience now, able to wait through dozens of days of tests before committing to decisions if needs must.


-Librarian (Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement) (100CP)
        You have a phenomenal memory and organizational skill, and a real gift for research. It's a rare day indeed where you can't find the information you need, or at least narrow it down to a single rare book.


-Nigredo (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (100CP)
        The first step is breaking things down to their basics, before putting them back together. You always understand how far you can atomize knowledge, and are able to source all the bits.
        If you're starting an experiment, you can use this to completely break down your starting premise, break down what you think you know, find every source for every one of those bits. You will keep discrete knowledge of what you think every step is doing, what it's checking for. If you get unexpected results, you'll be able to atomize what those results are, what conflicts with what you know, and what doesn't.
        This makes you no more right than you were before, but helps immensely in figuring out where you're wrong. Likewise, if you one day discover a source of yours was unreliable, you'll know every bit of information you got from him directly or indirectly, and be able to find every conclusion you're using that he contributed to.
        It won't tell you which ones are manipulations, but you'll know that you have a bias because of something he said to you in passing because you'll be able to identify every contributor to your every bias.


-Not a Stupid Grunt (Mass Effect) (100CP)
        That you are not. You are smart enough to be the foremost scientist in your field. This doesn't make you so, but you could get there on your own with not a terrible amount of effort. Still not as smart as a drell, but hey, who is?


-PhDs (Fantastic Four) (100CP)
        Now this is the most obvious thing for you to have, isn't it? You have no less than three separate PhD, covering any three areas of science you want. You're a leading expert and genius in each of these, a true giant in the field. But more than these, you find you now also have documents, proofs and complete records for any other degrees or qualifications you're, well, qualified to hold. So long as you have the ability, you find that whatever is needed to indicate this just appears, complete with a full story behind it. These records are entirely genuine, and are treated by everyone just as they would any other similar documents.


-Savant's Understanding (Exalted - The Infernals) (100CP)
        A good scholar is one that understands quickly, and remembers their lessons well. Gaining a sharpened mind, you will make connections and associations extremely quickly, your burgeoning mind filling with ideas and potential solutions. But remembrance is just as important, so you will find that your memory is clear and enjoy near-perfect recall. Indeed, the memories of life and technology in the First Age, which your Exaltation retains from its past life as a scholar of note, are likewise quite clear. Even better, you will find it easy to retain absurd amounts of newly acquired information. For some reason, this also makes it easier for you to construct elaborate monologues to reveal the full genius of your grand schemes.


-Terribly Clever (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (100CP)
        You are just so terribly clever, able to quickly think on your feet and spot connections where others usually cannot. As well as being an overall quick thinker you also find it a bit easier to study and retain information. You have the makings of a fabulous bookworm.


-Traditional Genius (SB Dragonball Z) (100CP)
        You're a traditional genius, a master of engineering, biology, and a dozen other sciences at the level of Bulma Briefs in each of them. If you'd been a part of the scientific community of your planet, you'd probably be considered the pinnacle of their scientists for generations to come. In addition to this your mind is far greater than the average person, giving you a base IQ of 250 as well as eidetic memory.


-Well Qualified (Green Lantern) (100CP)
        Pick one field of science. You're now a world class expert, a true genius not just in that field, but in all the fields associated with it. A Xenobiologist would also be a thoroughly brilliant Zoologist and a biologist overall, not to mention Astronomy. Now you don't get to claim 'Unified Theory' and become an expert at every field of science out there, but shy of that, this is what you need to become one of the top scientists out there.


-Well Researched (Lords of the Night - Liches) (100CP)
        The truth of the matter is that, no matter what you're doing, someone else was doing it before you. People say, don't reinvent the wheel, but the wheel has been reinvented countless times. You are good at avoiding having to reinvent things already made or discovered, though.
        Your mind is like a steel trap. Not only do you never forget anything, you're good at instantly putting everything you come across into context. This won't make you instantly cross-reference it with something from a completely different context, but when you think on things and try to figure something out, find a solution, or need something out of left field you can quickly scan across your entire body of knowledge for something that could help.
        This comes with you already being well studied on a huge range of topics, in this jump and all future ones you go to. Think of it as roughly ten doctorates' worth of study on a wide range of subjects, with a new set each new jump.
        You can leave minds that might actually be greater than yours in the dust, as they try to achieve something from first principles that was figured out by an obscure sage thirteen centuries ago, who only ever put his findings down in a single journal that has been gathering dust in some corner of a minor family library ever since.


-Living Library (Medaka Box Abnormal) (200CP)
        Won't ever have a need to study again, not for school and god be willing, not for life either. You've got a quite literally perfect memory. You memorise anything on experiencing it with any of your senses once, even for a flash. There is no limit to how much memory you can store at a time and even instantly recall any information that you have memorised with no delay, as if you had already been thinking of it. Of course, given that you've lived with this for years now, you've long since memorised a vast amount of information, both academic, practical and trivial.


-Mad Genius (Buffy the Vampire Slayer SB) (200CP)
        You might not think that a world such as this, with great supernatural powers, would also have examples of great technological genius, but it does. Greatly talented in the fields of science and technology, you are specifically adept at a field of your choice, such as robotics, chemistry or biology, able to step well beyond the limits of conventional science in that area. You could instead choose to specialize in combining magic with technology. Additional purchases add an additional specialty


-Methodical Approach (Lords of the Night - Liches) (200CP)
        Sometimes the best approach is plodding. It's like you have two extra minds. Not creative or innovative like your normal thoughts, but absolutely patient, and never stopping, slowing, or growing bored.
        If you need a material with a certain set of properties, they can go over everything you know about material science and systematically work through it until they find such a material. If you need to make a process more efficient, they can systematically go over all possible iterations, checking them one by one, simplifying one way, then another, and another, seeing what works and what doesn't.
        You always know how many steps you went up or down on a stairway, how long your stride was, how many windows you passed, and other such points of data. This doesn't give you bottomless memory, but the machine minds in the back of your head miss nothing, and can ponder anything and everything.
        They can even outperform a more brilliant mind, because they never dismiss anything and leave no stone unturned, even ones a more intuitive thinker would overlook. They excel at keeping the facts in mind, and only the facts. What they lack in creativity or innovation they make up for in being utterly systematic.
        You also find it easier to work methodically through things with your normal thoughts, and when you do you can work with the machine thoughts, using your intuition and creativity to help them overcome problems and find solutions faster.
        These extra thought trains always equal your normal ones in raw processing, but are otherwise crippled as described above. However, they will take on weakened shadows of any mental or social enhancing perks you possess.
        For example, if you have the Social Intelligence perk, they will pick up on social data, and can work with it despite not being creative or intuitive, processing through such data in bulk to help you solve larger social questions. They won't be as capable as if you focused on those things with your normal thoughts, but their methodical approach means they can handle bigger datasets then you can, and nothing stops you from considering the ideas and thoughts they come up with your normal less restricted thought processes.


-Muggle Technology (Make a Wish) (200CP)
        You know it, general knowledge of upto graduate level in every scientific field is known to you, not only this, but the knowledge seems very eager to help you and as such whenever you are using magic for creation of something or other, the knowledge will leap up with helpful facts and connect seemingly disconnected facts to help in whatever magical creation you are making next. Post Jump, the helpfulness and eagerness spreads to the rest of the knowledge you have in your mind.


-Omni-Disciplinary (My Life As A Teenage Robot) (200CP)
        When you're trying to create superpowered Robots, advanced machinery, or biological Monsters you can't afford to stick to one field, and being a jack of all trades isn't quite enough either. This perk not only gives you genius level knowledge in every scientific field as compared to the real world, but it also makes it so none of your knowledge and ability will suffer from branching out in this way, in fact as you pursue one field your knowledge in all the others will get a little clearer and easier to apply as your general understanding of the universe expands.


-Pioneer (The Games We Play) (200CP)
        You're not just a scientist, you're a true innovator, a pioneer! You just don't know the meaning 'limits'. No matter how much a science advances, how many discoveries or inventions are made, there is always the next horizon, and you never fail to know how to start chasing it. You have an instinct for advancing any fields you're interested in pursuing. Any failures are only new avenues to explore, and if all else fails, one branch of study eventually leads into another. You have an unlimited imagination and innovation, being able to tackle problems and questions in ways most people can't even imagine, let alone attempt. No matter what you start on, you find yourself making new and varied advances if on a regular basis, comprehending more and more as you go.


-Premier Education (Girl Genius SB) (200CP)
        The Spark does a lot, but it helps to have the right education. Village Sparks working with chicken entrails tend to die to pitchforks much more than city sparks working with sound principles. And now yours are the soundest of them all! This perk provides you an incredible, unbelievably thorough, advanced and extensive education in it, such that your knowledge and skills related to it are unquestionably along the absolute best in the world. This world being what it is, the field in question can be anything from biology to Space-Time analytics, Necromantic Construct Design and Engineering. The narrower the field the better your understanding of it, but as an absolute minimum this perk would provide you a top of the line, first class education like the kind you can get in Rome, Paris, Beetleburg or Castle Wulfenbach. You can buy this perk any number of times for more fields to be educated in. Comes with fully acknowledged Doctorates.


-Robotics (Rick And Morty) (200CP)
        You have spectacular ability in the fields of engineering and most notably robotics and find that making a robot to pass the butter at the breakfast table is a viable alternative to getting up.


-Unusual Specialization (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (200CP)
        There are fields of knowledge and advancement that a person is renowned for, and it's usually for a reason. You are now one of those people, a leading expert in something that the world looks to when they have questions regarding it. Whether this is Gamma Radiation, or Wormhole Physics, or Modular Design, or any one field of knowledge you deem fit so long as it would fit in this world. You may take this perk multiple times if you wish.


-Mechanical Genius (Final Fantasy IV) (300CP)
        Your ability to understand machinery is on a different level entirely. Working with a metal you've never touched to brace a machine? Cakewalk. New attachments on a precariously balanced airship? Might take a day, less with an assistant. You know machines, and exactly how to calibrate them to your exact specifications inherently without needing to actually run the numbers. It just works.


-Engineering Mastery IV (Essential Body Modification Supplement) (400CP)
        Learning speed increased by x1000, applies to design and fabrication fields. At this level, you can become an Expert (equivalent of a college degree and a few years of experience) in an hour and a world-class master in ten hours. See the Notes section of the Essential Body Mod Supplement for details on how learning speed is modified by different factors.


-Genius-Level Intellect (Bleach - Reborn Remade) (400CP)
        On par with the likes of Urahara, or Mayuri, you have an amazing intellect. Managing to reverse engineer specialty soul products in short time periods (like the Squad 0 hotsprings), to accurately predict the exact items you'll need for a battle before it begins.


-Genius (Fantastic Four) (400CP)
        What can I say? You are one. You have a brain that leaves supercomputers, all the supercomputers looking like an early 1900s adding machine. The speed at which your brain processes information is legendary as is your sheer intelligence and inventiveness. You could pioneer entire branches of science in your basement, or build equipment capable of affecting and manipulating the building blocks of the universe with nothing but what you could find in an ordinary 21st century lab. Any and all designs and items, be they technological or otherwise, leap for the chance to unveil their secrets to you, allowing you to understand every detail with just a glance. And more than understanding them, you have an instinctive gift for breaking such things down, improving them and copying stuff from one to the other. Just... don't become useless, Jumper.


-Genius (Rick And Morty) (400CP)
        You may not be the Rickest of Ricks but you are the smartest person in your own universe. Your capacity for invention is mind-boggling and even highly advanced alien civilizations barely hold a candle to you.


-Genius Intellect (Eureka-Warehouse 13-alphas) (400CP)
        You are one of the greatest minds to ever live. Well, that might be a touch hyperbolic, but you are most definitely deserving of the title genius by local standards, which are higher than most. Your raw mental processing, calculating, and problem solving ability is at least one, and usually several, orders of magnitude above the common man. Try not to let it go to your head.


-Genius Researcher (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (400CP)
        The gates of knowledge have been open to you since the first time you laid your eyes in the world and it only grew closer to you since then. There's no exaggeration when saying that technology advanced 100 years with your contributions alone; from A.I. with will on their own, chips that can mind control people, robotic limbs or weapons that can evade all the current security systems. There's no telling how much you can develop with the right motivation and resources.


-Great Man (Fate/Legends - Strange New World) (400CP)
        There's no dullards to be found here. You're a great mind and there's no doubt about it. A mind to match the likes of Nikola Tesla or the other Great Men of these modern times, you have intelligence and creative ability beyond any common man by far. Your knowledge of the sciences is vast, covering many different fields to quite great depth.
        One day you might work on plans to transform how the world sees energy, the next on weapons that could rock the military world to its core. You're knowledge outside of the sciences is quite limited, perhaps they never interested you as a child, but you do have two special qualities of your own.
        Either way, you're a brilliant and creative man but the first special advantage is great talent for improving and iterating upon the inventions of others. So long as another made it, you find yourself naturally realising how and where it could be improved, finding it easy to accomplish these further developments and even having some skill at taking the parts you like of a technology and applying them to something else.
        The other special trait you gain is to instead focus on the advancement of technology yourself, making new technology comes far faster to you, especially if no one else has explored the present field. You'll find the strange, the fantastical and the considered-impossible to be much easier for you to make possible and even feasible. You can buy this perk again to gain the second benefit.
        * Perk cost includes buying this twice.


-Info Processing (Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops) (400CP)
        You are not always stuck in a lab, you are useful in more areas than just that. You can process information, sensor readouts, intercepted communications, and more importantly, you can apply such knowledge. While others would use such data for tactics, you see opportunity for scientific advancement. The more information you have access to, the better opportunities you see for salvageable materials, technologies, or data. And you can use those to relatively quickly implement a usable and useful technology.


-Jack of All Trades (Andromeda) (400CP)
        Like Hohne you are a prodigy at learning all fields of science and engineering. Learning what would take geniuses years in weeks. You can push the limits of science and engineering to new heights, but it will still take time to learn everything that is out there.
        Capstone Boosted: Master of all - You are now like Seamus Harper and can learn anything that would take geniuses decades to learn in days. You can still learn non-scientific/engineering things in weeks or months instead of years thanks to your impressive learning skills. Given enough time and knowledge there is nothing you can not claim to be greatest in.


-Jeune Ecole (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        When it comes to building new and improved things, there is no one quite like you. You're a genius among geniuses. While your skills cover a large spectrum, you specialize in communications and weapons, being able to design systems and weaponry decades in advance of your closest peers.
        While this perk provides you no help when it comes to making whole ships or shipyards, within your field you're practically unmatched. You could take a normal design and come up with a hundred new ideas, and they will all be completely feasible ideas that will actually be massively helpful to your side. Getting them produced may be expensive and time consuming, but once they're ready they will be decades ahead of the curve.


-Leading Light (DCEU) (400CP)
        You've got the brawn already, now it's time for you to get some brains. There are few minds like yours on Earth, as you're smart enough to produce an incredible array of advanced technology if you put your mind to it. You've got an in depth knowledge on almost every field of science there is and know how to turn that knowledge into working technology, such as the devices and vehicles that Batman uses to fight crime with. You're even able to, with a lot of time and effort, reverse engineer alien technology. It'll probably take a few months to do so without some seriously high tech laboratories but it's not out of your reach. If you just want to figure out how some alien tech works, it shouldn't take you more than a few minutes though.


-Life or Death (Subnautica) (400CP)
        They laughed when you studied the life sciences, but you'll show them! You are now an expert chemist and virologist, capable of whipping up dangerous mixtures on command. Toxic warheads, advanced medkits, and poisons capable of killing Leviathans are now in your mind's eye. You'll need access to various chemical sources, but I'm sure you'll find what you need if you keep your scanner out.


-Like a Robot (Invincible) (400CP)
        Your mind is a masterpiece. You think faster than a normal human being; you can process in a second what would have before taken you a minute. You have the ability to split your mind in twain to concentrate on more than one thing at a time. In the beginning you would be limited to dividing your mind into 10 different streams of thought, each of which has the full processing power of your entire mind. Given time however, something on the scale of decades, you will be able to split your mind exponentially more, giving you enough subdivisions to run the world, control an army, and a police force of millions of separate robot suits all the while manipulating global politics. Given even more time, who knows how far you could take this.


-Mad Geneticist (Rick And Morty) (400CP)
        Sometimes science is more art than science and you find that this is doubly true when it comes to genetics. When you have a vague idea of the attributes you want to impart from a species you find them remarkably easy to splice into a different species. It won't even backfire that often. Probably. Be careful.


-Master of Engineering (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
        Within your lofty cranium rests a mind the likes of which only appears once or twice a generation. Ideas dance through your mind like brilliant fireflies all you have to do is reach out and grasp them. Visions of whirling gears and pumping oil; of lightning bottled in cages of glass and copper; of crystal lenses and formulas that write themselves...the spark of invention drives you to produce marvels ahead of their time - indeed with effects that seem to outstrip the technology of the device itself. Build a combat automaton from cogs and steel, record whole conversations on a single punch card, devise security systems which can recognise specific people, all these and more. If you merely had the funding and the time to refine these visions into physical form, you could unleash your marvels onto the world and you, too, could be spoken of in the same breath as Sokolov, Roseborrow, and Jindosh.


-Modern Insight (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (400CP)
        One of the greatest advantages of humanity in this world and the best weapon for any alchemist: creativity. The wonders of the mind, the imagination that eventually lead to dreams becoming reality. For a creator has no better tool than his own mind, and yours is a well of ideas without end. Each meeting, each view is but a mountain of new ideas forming in your mind, each better than the last. When it comes to innovation, your works are assured to be the best around. Now, you only need enough time, materials and skill to make those dreams a reality.


-Omega-Level Intellect (Doctor Who) (400CP)
        By taking this perk you have become one of the most brilliant entities to ever exist. You now have a mind fit to shake the universe, one that even the greatest intellects of an entire race of hyper-intelligent beings with a unique perception of time, space, and reality would be forced to acknowledge as a peer... or more. You are able to dismiss as trivially easy the sort of challenges that lesser geniuses would consider their life's masterwork. You have essentially no limits on what you can comprehend, design, or build except available knowledge, resources, and time... and the inherently hard limits of whatever reality you might happen to be in, of course. Although even those can be bent, if not broken. This perk does not grant you any knowledge you don't already have but from now on there will never be anything that you cannot comprehend with sufficient effort. It won't always be easy, it might take more than mortal lifetimes of study and research to unravel the truly fundamental mysteries of existence, and for things on Jump-Chan's level or higher 'sufficient effort' is defined as 'post-Spark'... but your intellect is now potentially infinite. Technology of all kinds, no matter how advanced, yields its secrets to you with barely a glance at the relevant bits and this type of learning speed carries over in all other fields of expertise. Your mind is a quicksilver-brilliant thing, capable of computations and interpolations that leave the finest computers in the galaxy, any galaxy, looking like an abacus being operated by a chimpanzee. Your capacity for multitasking is similarly scaled, making you capable of things like flawlessly solo piloting an infinitely complex spaceship that would normally take half a dozen geniuses to operate and other minor tricks of similar kind.


-Quick study (Factorio) (400CP)
        So much to learn, so little time. You absorb new information at a ridiculous rate, retain it perfectly, and can recall anything on a moment's notice. Your optimized mental processing vastly increases your intelligence, and offers protection against drugs, damage, or other things that would impair your mind or tamper with your memories.


-Scientific Mastery IV (Essential Body Modification Supplement) (400CP)
        Learning speed increased by x1000, applies to scientific fields. At this level, you can become an Expert (equivalent of a college degree and a few years of experience) in an hour and a world-class master in ten hours. See the Notes section of the Essential Body Mod Supplement for details on how learning speed is modified by different factors.


-Technician (Alpha Centauri) (400CP)
        Learning has become easier for you now, especially in the field of natural science and engineering, you absorb and retain information like a sponge and can mix and match theory and experience with much greater skill.


-The Crazed Toymaker (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        In the time of readily-available high technology and smart fabrication, there are two qualities that win fights: Overwhelming firepower, and pure deviousness. I can't speak for the former, but of the latter you seem to have an inexhaustible supply. Designing and building deadly trinkets is your forte, little horrific nick-knacks that kill not through big booms but through precision, trickery and the sheer unexpectedness of their nature. From tiny disguised drones with neurotoxin injectors, spider mines, hyperfilament snare-webs and crabbers, all the way up to ship- killing photon-sails and proximity limpets, you are never lacking the inspiration to invent a new, deadly toy specially designed to slip through your enemies' defenses and rip their hearts out.


-The Very Model of a Scientist Salarian (Mass Effect) (400CP)
        You've studied species turian, asari and batarian (and more). You're quite good at genetics (as a subset of biology) because you are an expert (which you know is a tautology). Your xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian, you are the very model of a scientist salarian. Can sing a little. Little you cannot give insight into due to your vast range of knowledge. Little that you have a hard time getting into due to your vast starting base. You could brute-force the vast majority of "impossible" scientific endeavors in this world with your relentless application of logic.


-Xenobiologist (DOOM 3) (400CP)
        The denizens of hell are equally terrifying and magnificent, in their own way. You have been extensively trained in the biological sciences, yet even your understanding is merely a starting point for these strange beings. Superhuman strength and resilience, the ability to manifest and control confined plasma charges, teleportation you don't know how they do it. But you will. Your talents grant you immense insight into any biological system, and through study and research, you'll eventually be able to understand even the most bizarre and alien biologies and, with enough skill, even replicate them. Hell is the way forward, and you intend to study it every step of the way.
        This Perk grants you a 50CP stipend which you may use in the Mysteries Of Mars or Hell's Might sections found further in this document.


-Mega Attributes: Intelligence (Trinity: Aberration) (500CP)
        Outperform even the most advanced supercomputer clusters. You receive one of the following Enhancements for free:
        Taint resistance: Your grey matter is extremely durable. Any form of insanity you had before eruption is healed, and neural dysfunction as a result of Node growth will be greatly reduced. Your brain will also be far better at self-repair and working around injuries or drugs that impair mental functions.
        Analyze Weakness: Nothing is perfect, and you can easily identify flaws in what you can observe. This requires at least a basic understanding of the mechanics behind something, but you are otherwise not limited in what this Enhancement can apply to. Anything from structures to complex systems to bureaucratic procedures.
        Mental Prodigy: You naturally grok a particular field of study. Learning new skills, making advancements and intuitive leaps within this area comes easily to you. Your chosen field might be anything from a specific scientific field like engineering or medicine, finance, forensic science or military tactics.


-Scientist | Elder Immortal (UQ Holder) (500CP)
        Elder Immortal (300CP)
        Not some young thing anymore, are you? No, you've been here for quite a while. Centuries in fact. Instead of starting as a hot blooded youth, just coming into their immortal life, you'll begin as an immortal who has already been present in this world for several hundred years. While this has certainly given you a wealth of background memories, provided you chose to have any, the main effect this has is that it has boosted certain perks to account for centuries of use, practice and study.
        These perks will be marked with an (EI) in their title and their effects will be described in a second paragraph below the main perk description. If you choose a Demihuman option that has powers of it's own, Elder Immortal will also give similar levels of skill and experience with them as it would do the perks and immortality options.
        Scientist (200CP)
        The power that you need is all there in your head already. The many disciplines of science and academics became your swords and spells to use against your foes. With a brilliant mind able to keep up with humanity's best, you've taken on a very wide degree of learning in a variety of different fields. Enough that even without specialising in a specific study, you can do things like creating combat capable robots, jetpacks, laser weapons, short ranged teleports and a variety of other devices able to mimic lower strength magic.
        Focusing on one field in particular might let you threaten a moderately strong wizard or fighter with your creations. You do need to put in the time and resources to create things however. With this, you'll start with a few decent creations to help you in battle, such as some capable firearms and armor or a powerful robotic assistant you created.
        Elder Immortal Boost Centuries of study, research and cribbing from every other genius you can have left you quite the astounding genius. Your mind boosted into the stratosphere by training and enhancements, it's allowed you to come to be close or even an equal to legends like Chao herself. With enough time and money, there is little that is impossible for you to create through science. Time and dimension travel, space elevators to connect Earth and Mars, machines or cyborg bodies capable of destroying entire cities. It's all possible, though some can still be pretty time consuming, and choosing to specialise will greatly aid your speed and talent.


-9.3TB Equation (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (600CP)
        Being synched to a Valkyrie Core enhances your mental abilities allowing you to quickly process the large amounts of information generated from the battlefield. With this perk this mental boost is increased allowing you to process vast amounts of data or become practically omniscient in the local area with the right sensors. Even when desynched to your Valkyrie Core your mental abilities will be boosted although to a lesser extent. You also learn new skills and abilities slightly quicker in addition to not worrying about having a stroke from trying to process too much data at once.


-A Spark of Genius (Girl Genius SB) (600CP)
        Or you might be an absolute, incomparable genius in general, I guess. While anyone who takes the Scientist Origin may be a weak spark if they wish to, this is where you go for the good stuff. You now have, and thus are, one of the strongest Sparks on the planet now, an absolute, blazing genius like Agatha Heterodyne,either of the Wulfenbachs, Dr Vapnoople, or others at the same tier.
        The Spark, that something that makes the wonders of this world possible, is plugged into your mind and soul, inflaming it, filling it with a fire that boosts your mental facilities to unbelievable extents such that many things that should be impossible... suddenly aren't. While you specialise in some field to extraordinary degrees, like being able to create artificial sparks if you choose 'Von Neumann Clanks', your genius is unbound by the petty concerns lesser sparks suffer from, allowing you to shine equally bright in every field from Microbiology to Trans-Dimensional Aeronautics.
        You have an instinctive grasp for scientific principles, can reverse engineer technology more or less just from seeing it, and have a head for calculation and numbers that defies belief. You can decrypt data in your head, have a completely flawless memory, and are in general the quintessential Mad Scientist. Complete with a gift for cackling and rants that can terrify anyone who isn't, by the way.
        When in the Madness Place, especially, you have an outright effect that allows you to warp time and space in a small area around you, letting you do weeks' worth of work in hours, and outright warp, twist, spindle the mutilate the very laws of physics as you craft your wonders... and horrors. Apart from the SCIENCE!, you have a charisma that borders on mind control, as anyone without a spark, or an exceptionally strong willpower is drawn into your orbit by your sheer force of will, ready to help and serve wherever they can. Your body is also somewhat better than most, allowing you to go all those all-nighters without food and fight off highly trained fighters while barely paying attention.
        Exemplar Boosted Your talents with the sparks cross the basic boundaries all the way, transforming you into something altogether beyond. You have had the second breakthrough, the transformation that makes you from a Spark into true Spark Royalty! You are like one of the Immortal God-Queens of old, of which only a precious few remain today.
        You're not a fully grown, matured God-Spark like Albia, but you're further along than Agatha or Lord Snackleford. Along with having psychic powers like levitation and telepathy, you can release blasts of pure energy to scour your foes from the earth. You can see in more than three dimensions, and even interact with beings beyond the mortal plane in several ways. You have the power to shapeshift freely, going from giant to normal in an instant, and acquiring any colour, appearance or form you desire.
        You can possess willing subjects, and break any mind control or subversion on your subjects. You can control energy in various forms, most of them rather unspecified. Most importantly, of course, your talents with actual Sparking transcend any ordinary sparks entirely, being almost as much beyond them as they are beyond mundane scientists. You have a surfeit of ideas, almost as if you can do anything!
        You don't even need to bother with Madness Places very much anymore, that is, being 'Suspended in an Eternal Moment of Supreme Clarity'. You do retain your ability to scare lesser minds out of their skin just by talking. Oh, and you gain a rotating Halo of any symbols of your choice, turning around your head in an endless circle. Basically, you have somewhat weaker versions of any powers displayed by Albia, even those not mentioned here. And you would grow to match her as soon as you acquire enough experience. You can hide the obvious bits of this, but why would you want to?


-Brain the Size of a Planet (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) (600CP)
        You are now possessed of a brain that is, metaphorically speaking, the size of a planet. How it fits in your head is anyone's guess, but it's big enough to store quintillions of years of memories flawlessly, instantly recall anything you've ever seen, heard, thought, dreamed, imagined, or learned, never degrade, and output it into any format you can conceive of. Not only that, but you can deliberately forget anything you've ever learned... and be perfectly aware you've deleted it... and undelete it later if you feel like it, though you can never be compelled to do that last. You could even schedule it to undelete itself at some later date. Anyone attempting to access your memory without your permission is liable to get lost in the nigh-infinite maze of idle wonderings or catalogues of all the itches you've ever had and never be heard from again. Of course, a brain isn't only for memorizing things, and so you've now got the equivalent mental processing power of one hundred billion genius level human beings. Does not come with crippling depression about how small the thought processes of mere mortals are.


-Comic Book Science (DC Multiverse - Earth 11) (600CP)
        You're extremely intelligent, easily one of the smartest people on the planet. You could build a massive company from scratch and revolutionize the sciences if you so choose. Your genius allows you to remember everything you've ever seen in great detail, hold multiple trains of thought at once, pick up new information and master skills very quickly, and build futuristic technology that seems to ignore conventional physics. Intellectually, you rival Lex Luthor and Ms. Terrific.


-First Thinker (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        Now we're getting somewhere. Among your particular species, you're a revolutionary one-of-a-kind mind that calling you a genius would be severely downplaying your potential impact on the universe. You are a paragon of knowledge and technology among your kind, to the point when they say 'on the shoulders of giants' you are very much that giant. A human at this level could advance the technology level of Earth by a dozen levels in less a few years, while a Galvan with this level would be one of the few minds Azmuth would call an equal. Whatever the case, you know how to innovate and advance technology light years ahead of the norm, elevating your species potentially millennia ahead of where they are now. Things like faster than light travel, laser weapons, completed starships and techno-organic constructs? For many, those things are groundbreaking and new. For you, they're only the tip of what you can accomplish.


-Genius Intellect (Young Justice) (600CP)
        Despite your apparent age, you possess one of the greatest minds that the world has ever seen. Your ability to come up with ideas and invent is nearly unparalleled, and actually building your inventions is child's play. What's more, your inventions have a lot more room in terms of following conventional physics; you can create things like teleportation devices, collars that nullify superpowers, and more.


-God Father (Supergod) (600CP)
        Impressive as they are, the Super Gods were made by human hands. For all their great powers, they originated with human ingenuity. Great minds like yours are what created these beings. You are incredibly intelligent, among the greatest minds humanity has ever seen, and the foremost expert in the entire world on a specific kind of science. Biology, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, whatever you chose to be centuries ahead of the rest of the world in is what you are currently working on a project to create a Super God from. With your experience, you are especially skilled at creating monsters out of your chosen field of science but even outside of that purpose, you are absurdly skillful in creating effective technologies based on your choice.


-Legendary Master- Intellectual (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert at research and scientific advancement of all kinds. There is no technology beyond your capability for reverse-engineering or eventually decoding. So long as you have a clear goal in mind for the development of a piece of tech you can eventually manufacture it. All research work you complete is not only doubled but is also impossibly easy to understand to even the most simple-minded luddite. With your blueprints even a group of tribal humans could find the stars within their grasp. Sidenote: actually doing so is another story altogether.


-Malkuth Theory (The Games We Play) (600CP)
        You possess the greatest power of all, that of the human mind, ever seeking knowledge and understanding. Your mind, scientific ability and sheer talent are like something out of a legend, and a terrifying one at that.You're a genius on a level that leaves the greatest of geniuses despairing at their unworthiness. Forget the greatest minds of this age, the very Archangels and their creators would have found themselves jealous of the sheer ease with which sciences of all kinds and colors come to you, nature almost eager to reveal its secrets. You start out at the limit of this era's understanding of science, with what amounts to a degree in everything, but worry not, the vast and wondrous creations of the Angels and Archangels are far from being beyond your reach, with it being only a matter of time before you reach the same levels in them. After this world you don't get any knowledge ex-nihilo, but your skills translate perfectly to all branches of study you ever encounter, providing you equal talent and potential.


-One in a Trillion (Infinite Stratos) (600CP)
        Only one other person in the world possesses the grand level of intelligence you now find yourself in possession of, Tabane Shinonono. Comparing you to any sort of normal human mind would be a joke, because you're decades ahead of the rest of the world. You think faster, better and so far outside the box they'd need to measure in miles. You don't know anything more than you do right now but with a mind like this, it'll be a matter of weeks before you're zooming past the experts and making the beginnings of something special. Mighty robots, dimensional pockets, space flight and true artificial intelligence are all just the beginning.


-Over-Science (How A Realist Hero Rebuilt The Kingdom) (600CP)
        A genius. That's what you are. Your creativity, thinking outside the box and intelligence are comparable to greatest minds of history like Da Vinci or, in this world, to Maxwel. While you aren't someone to make spaceships with the current technology of this world, your creations are more than enough to bring a new industrial revolution to the continent. That's it, as long as you can produce and market your inventions.


-Philosopher Scientist (Grant Morrison's 18 Days) (600CP)
        In the Silver Age, the Great Sage Vishwamitra decreed that Trishanku (born Satyavrata of the Solar Dynasty), the King of Ayodhya, was to be let into heaven with his mortal body. When denied this by the gods, Vishwamitra crafted a new heaven for Trishanku to rule over as the new Indra. Only the beseechments by the gods prevented this from becoming reality.
        You are not quite the equal of Vishwamitra, for he was a giant among men even in the Days of Silver. But you are among the closest that exist in this base era. Yours is the mastery of all the sciences and arts of the world, from the biological expertise to the chemical and the magical, needed to craft all the wonders and miracles that exist in this time and place.
        With this blessing your intelligence, speed of thought, and aptitude towards any and all fields of science and magic both are heightened to tremendous, absurd degrees. Your memory is limitless and unalterable, and your ability to recall it instant and flawless. You can think and do any number of things at once, possessing truly unlimited multitasking.
        Combined with Yajnatek, you will be able to summon and bind gods, lay down bindings of fate in the forms of boons and curses, craft great works of magic that make and break empires, and more. At the same time, your scientific aptitude would let you craft gadgets and wonders like the Vimanas, Godly weapons and armor any deity or Super warrior would be proud to wield, or even wonders like the Rishi Computer Markandeya, or even works like the Maya Mahal, the palace of wonders from where Yudish once ruled.
        You can also combine any and all of your gifts, crafting together technology, psionics and magic into works that can do anything either can, as well as machines to cast magic, and others that combine the best of both worlds to achieve even greater results.


-Sane Science (Superman the Animated Series) (600CP)
        Biology, chemistry, engineering and physics are your tools. Progress is your purpose. With your intellect and enough time and resources there is nothing you can't accomplish. From cloning to robotics, nanotech to hard light, computer programming to space travel, anything is within your reach.


-The Art and Science (Endless Pantheon) (600CP)
        Magic and Science, two sides of the same coin. You are a master of both, now. You are a genius without peer, skilled almost beyond comparison at any and all forms of 'book' learning. Your skills in magic equal that of the best Wizards of the White Council, and your skills at Science are comparable to those of the finest scientists among the goa'uld, and they only grow from here. You learn in hours and days what others need months for, be it languages, branches of science or schools of magic. You're also extremely good at teasing the maximum possible efficiency out of things, be they technology or magic, such that your spells have refinement and precision virtually unmatched. This can be both practical, such as using super-fine lasers where others would use torrents of flame, or in terms of your long term work, such as software that you can write utilizing unbelievably little resources to be extraordinarily effective and robust.


-The Ever Expanding Tree (Stellaris) (600CP)
        Science is something that people do not think of very much, in their minds it is almost like magic, simply looking into something and after an undisclosed amount of time, poof! You however know that is not how Science works, you know that it is a doctrine for which to follow when one wishes to understand the Universe safely and efficiently. You have mastered this doctrine, and because of it your ability to discover new technological heights is virtually infinite allowing you to continually discover more and more technologies without any limit. To add to this you can even branch out seemingly useless pieces of technology into something completely unfathomable. For example you could use the basis for a toaster to create a giant space station that superheats planets. While this may seem almost fantastical, the general rules of research still apply, and because of this you must still conduct actual research and experiments.


-The Mind (Megamind) (600CP)
        Ah, the good stuff. You arrive from the same planet from Megamind unless you don't. Either way, just like him you are a grade-A, five star genius on a comic book level, unmatchable and brilliant by all. Not only can you create things like invisible vehicles, death rays lasers and illusion generators, you are also a genius of the equal degree in all other fields, finding it just as easy to bioengineer a fish into sapience as to build a huge robot. Moreover, you can do all this on your typical city-level mostly unsuccessful villain's resources. You can get by with even the most limited or inferior resources, even if you might end up making wheels out of bent license plates now and then. You're particularly good at making tech that interacts with superpowers, be it replicating them, recreating them with samples from the holder, or boosting, weakening or even disabling them.


-The New Doctor Bowman (Freefall) (600CP)
        You've read the works of Feynman, Newton, Einstein, and John Von Neumann and honestly, they don't hold a candle to you. Your brilliance is such that in most every field of study you can easily become a household name and when you choose a particular discipline it really shines through. Even if you managed to keep your personal details and identity secret, what you've created will not just be mentioned in history books but may become a defining point in history. Works well to increase your learning speed as well as enhance effects of other perks that increase both general intelligence and knowledge of specific fields of study.


-Urkel's Intellect (Family Matters) (600CP)
        You are beyond brilliant. With a standard public school education and the resources of a middle-class teenager, you could invent technologies that previously only existed in science fiction. The best way to describe your mental prowess is to say that you are a comic-book genius, potentially capable of inventing technology to allow cloning, neural downloads, teleportation, shrink rays, genetic manipulation, or even time travel. What is more, you possess the same level of ability in all sciences and technologies that you put any effort into, whether it be computers, robotics, biology, chemistry, physics or any other. Any gains made in one area are equalled in those other fields.


-Virology (Prototype) (600CP)
        Looking at it from a technical standpoint, viruses are just devices that carry genes, they enter the nucleus, insert their genome, and then the host cell does everything else for them. This characteristic makes viruses one of the most favored devices in genetic engineering, as they can go and infect multiple cells. The folks at Gentek know this, and focus solely on them, but you have a leg up on them. By extensive study (but still far less than a computer could) you can decode the entire genome of a life-form, and decode and isolate the genes responsible for any and every trait that they possess. Want the eyes of a goat on the body of a snake? Or possibly just the strength of a rhinoceros? Do not look away, study and decode today!


-Wakeman Tech (My Life As A Teenage Robot) (600CP)
        This perk gives you the ability to create technology on par with that made by the esteemed Nora Wakeman. At a base this gives you a unique talent for making absurdly efficient technology that can reshape itself and compress down into impossibly small shapes and sizes. With enough time and study you can replicate anything she ever built or equivalents to them, including XJ-Units .


-We're Going To Change The World Peter (Spider-Man PS4) (600CP)
        Few are the men that can look down on the world like you do. Your mind is one of those that will be looked back on in centuries time as one of the greatest in history. You have all the potential to change the world with your intelligence. Create a cure for cancer, true cybernetic bodies, unlock the secrets of turning matter to pure energy or creating true space flight.
        They'll likely take years of work but you well and truly can change the world. But why cure cancer when you can make superheroes and monsters instead? You might have a world class mind but you also have truly superb talent for creating technology meant to interact with super powers. Giving, taking or altering the superhuman powers found in this world.
        Making a man have the powers of a spider or creating a monstrous symbiote superweapon or sealing the negative powers of a poor young child. Even technology meant to enhance, weaken or otherwise interact with these powers is within your grasp. While you have no experience with magic, you might perhaps learn to apply some principles from your work here to that field too.


-And Where to Find Them | You Have Been Reborn (Invincible) (1000CP)
        And Where To Find Them (600CP)
        You are beyond all doubt a super genius. You are a creative and intuitive genius that could build futuristic projects, make armours capable of fighting veteran Viltrumites to a standstill and reverse engineer or better alien technologies that are centuries more advanced than you are. You are also quite skilled at cloning technologies and enhancing normal people far beyond their original limits through cybernetics, genetic modification and incredibly sophisticated gear.
        Without a doubt you are one of the most intelligent individuals in the world, with a knack for the physical and mass production sides of science. While you can go beyond the more physical sciences, it may take you about fifteen years to properly create a time travel device or a device that would allow you to hop between universes.
        Capstone Boosted: Screw being one of the smartest beings on the planet you are without a doubt the smartest being on the planet. Master time travel technology, hop between universes before brunch, build incredible FTL drives. You alone could catapult the Earth into being a major player in the galaxy through technological prowess within your lifetime. Screw reverse engineering alien tech, aliens now want to reverse engineer your tech.
        You Have Been Reborn (400CP)
        You have somehow been caught in a time machine accident, and have been reconstituted with molecules from millions of years in the future. Thanks to this you have become better than you once were, far better.
        You have gained slightly beyond peak human physical and mental attributes, and neither your body or skills ever degrade in any way due to the passing of time or lack of exertion. Given time and effort you could easily win the entire Olympics if you'd like, break world records daily, become the greatest Chess Master in the world, these are all now possible for you. Beyond this however you have gained a minor ability to use Telekinesis. Able to use Telekinesis to lift a maximum of 10 lbs currently, though should you train enough this ability will quickly grow seemingly without limit. Given a year or two, you might be able to lift houses with no effort.
        More than this however these future atoms seem to have had an interesting effect on your existing abilities and will operate as a Capstone Booster on all capstones.




 --- Domain: Knowledge: Reverse Engineering (18) (42 Perks) --- 




-Crazed Physician (Van Helsing) (100CP)
        Amongst the many sciences and paths you know, aside from the usual Ominous Cackling, you... Can actually patch people up easily. As a Crazed Physician, you can use the plainest tools on hand to mend any variety of wounds and injuries. As well, you know the human anatomy down to the last blood vessel, and can learn the anatomy of any other creature you dissect more easily.


-Cultured (Generic Isekai) (200CP)
        You're from another world, one vastly different from the one you're in now. More importantly, a world filled with countless luxuries and entertainments. You have a natural skill for understanding and reproducing any sort of food, game, toy, or other luxury item that you have personally experienced. Even if you lack the necessary tools or ingredients, you can manage to cobble something together from what's on hand. Once you get the hang of it, you can even figure out how to produce it cheaply and reliably, as long as it's even remotely possible. And once you do that, it's child's play to introduce these foreign delights to a new society. Give some orcs the joys of curry, or distribute othello boards to elven tribes. It's fun and profitable!


-Dr Shen, I presume? (Endless Space) (200CP)
        You are really knowledgeable at learning from your foes. You always seem to learn something new whenever you salvage enemies equipment. New weapons, armor, agriculture, the works. Every piece of enemy salvage you obtain gives you new insight into fields of science you had not yet explored. Beating the crap out of a caveman won't teach you how to make new laser cannons, but it will give you new insight into obsidian knapping methods, or animal hide tanning. Knowledge gained is related to what you are looking at.


-Finger of Silver (Macross) (200CP)
        While other kids were building tinker-toy creations, you were fiddling with your dad's car and doing a better job than him. By purchasing this, meddling with machines and OverTechnology is as easy as breathing for you. By getting your hands on something, you can easily figure out how it works and how to copy its inner workings, provided that it wasn't just bullshit magic. The more advanced something is, the harder it may be... but with time and effort, you just might succeed.


-What's This Do? (Titanfall) (200CP)
        The technology used in the frontier can be so complex and advanced it takes years for even the most brilliant minds to understand. Really now? That's good, you needed something to do after lunch today. Now, even if you're in a dropship in the middle of a firefight, you can decipher the inner workings of technology so long as you have the controls to scre- I mean analyze.


-Xenospecialist (Gears of War) (200CP)
        The problem with fighting and violence is that it's no place for an egghead, and as a result valuable information could be lost to a wayward grenade before study. You've taken it upon yourself to bring that knowledge back, and as such you have an easier time understanding alien language and technology. It won't give you instant knowledge, but as you study further you will find it becomes easier to comprehend.


-Analysis (Adventure Time) (300CP)
        You have the skill and insight to make powerful analytical tools. Such tools are capable of showing you the physical makeup of the things you come across, detect magic and alert you to hidden doorways.


-ANALYSIS (Medaka Box Abnormal) (300CP)
        Understanding is by far the most important thing. Once you know what you're dealing with, you can formulate a plan to deal with it. You're just great at both. You're able to effortlessly and intuitively analyse and understand anything that you can see or touch. The more complex or strange the thing is, the more time you might need to understand it, but even Abnormalities can be figured out with a few caresses and a couple seconds of consideration. Your understanding tells you how and why anything you've analysed works and then gives you the knowledge on how best to bring out its full potential, letting you turn people or objects into the best they can be over time, so long as they're open to your training plans.


-Clever Kitty (CATastrophe) (300CP)
        Earless tech isn't usually easy to understand, but for whatever reason the inner workings come to you easily enough. You don't understand how every bit of Earless teknologee works, but you have the basics down to an exact science. So long as the teknologee you're studying still adheres to the laws of physics (though they may be ones you don't know about), you can with time and the right tools discern how it works. Of course, replicating it without the proper resources will be a problem, as will the time needed to recreate anything more complex than a toaster.


-Bolthole Protocol (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        While coming up with unbelievably advanced new designs may not be exactly your forte, what is is the reverse engineering of the same. You need only spend a few moments working at something to get a basic idea of how it works, and only get faster from there. No matter how advanced or obscure the technology, you can eventually work it out, with a thousandth the time and effort it would take anyone else.


-Enemy Tech Progression (Orion's Arm: The Amalgamation) (400CP)
        Any technological device that you have subverted will reveal its inner workings to you. The blueprints, knowledge and methods that go into the creation and operation of the technology you subvert is automatically uploaded to your mind. If you cannot subvert a technological device, you can still learn its secrets, but at a far reduced rate. You are also able to more quickly grasp the inner workings of those subverted devices to improve on, and upgrade them.
-Improbable Crafting Skills (Generic Isekai 4chan) (400CP)
        You're an expert at recreating modern technologies with atypical resources. Even if you don't know the full mechanics or manufacturing process for a particular item, you'll be able to craft it with local materials or supernatural abilities through experimentation or sheer magical power. Post-jump, you'll also have a much easier time interchanging materials and processes for technologies not native to your original world.


-Reverse Engineering (Sekirei) (400CP)
        Bizarre alien technology, superrobots, genetic engineering. You might not know these disciplines, but with just a single example to test to destruction, you should be able to figure out how it (used) to work, how to apply the principles to new tech, and with a few projects under your belt, remake the original!


-Reverse Engineering (Stellaris) (400CP)
        Sometimes other Empires are plain better than yours when it comes to technology and use of it. That is where this comes in. As long as you can get your hands on a piece of technology, you can understand it after several days of study. Another Empire has new lasers that outshine yours? Well all you need to do is get your hands on a mostly working version and you're set to go.


-Reverse Engineering (Worm) (400CP)
        While you still possess an amount of scientific knowledge beyond the curve of modern society, your base technical knowledge is far less than other Tinkers. This is however because your power lets you reverse engineer the principles and workings of anything you can get your hands on, and then apply that knowledge and understanding to your own work. Just seeing a device and watching it function gives you a vague idea as to how it works, and examining something means you can derive the hows and whys as to its functions. This requires time and effort on your part, in addition to the time and resources it'll take to actually implement this new knowledge, but as long as you put in the necessary investment you can always understand virtually any new technology. Your Tinker abilities will continue to expand as you gain access to new technology and knowledge, with potentially no upper limit as long as you can keep gaining samples to work with.


-Salvage Savant (I Have A Mansion In The Post Apocalypse) (400CP)
        Inventing technology is well and good, but often, and especially in the Post-Apocalypse,there is much more sense in working on comprehending the wisdom of the past. And you're brilliant at it now, with this. Be it systems and technology from before the apocalypse or just wisdom and learnings about life in a more general sense, when it comes to understanding what has been done before, there are few who can beat you. You are also much luckier than usual at finding things to salvage; even places that everybody else swore were 'picked clean' still seem to have at least a few useful items you can turn up.
        No matter how advanced or obscure, the principles and secrets on which any given items or techniques work unveil themselves to you with little more than a glance at the production action, as do any more... spiritual or otherwise esoteric aspects of things. You could single-handedly gift the greatest glories of a world's history back to them, with some time and effort.


-The Only One Who Bothered To Learn (Iron Sky) (400CP)
        Yeah, it might very well occur in this world that people would refuse to learn how to fix things while living in a place where day-to-day survival depends on them and others fixing things in time. You have no such problems, thankfully. You're a genius at figuring out, reverse engineering and patching together any and all kinds of technology. You can patch in new power sources on the fly, or work out how to jury-rig devices to perform functions they aren't even designed to, at times.


-upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!! (Red Faction) (400CP)
        You can make it all better. By studying a piece of technology for a short while, you can come up with ways to improve its functions or fix design flaws, though you'll still need the related technical skills to figure out details. In addition, you can use salvaged materials in lieu of fresh parts for this task.


-Xeno-Archaeologist (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (400CP)
        Let the tech-priests wring their hands over tech-heresy, you know that all xenos and archaeotech works on sound physical principles. They worked before, and can be made to work again. You are a master of figuring out and reverse engineering technology, taking less than a tenth the time it would take a Guild workshop, and about a millionth the time it would take the AdMech.


-Dead Men Have No Secrets (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        You've got samples of a civilization's tech, and maybe even pure data recovered from their computers. But now what? Now, you actually get to use them. You now have the fantastic ability to reverse engineer unknown technologies, and the more alien they are to you, the better you are at it. The reason why is because a civilization's technology isn't just one single thing. You can detect the intricacies behind every little detail, and extrapolate from those details how a civilization thinks, what materials they'd use and why, and so on. The wider the variety of samples you have, the greater the insights you have into every level of their civilization. And once you know how they thought, you can make your own versions of copies of their tech, as if you were a scientist of that civilization. You are not just acquiring raw data, but understanding what you are discovering.
        Capstone boost: With an AI backing you up, you are able to process information much faster. When you observe a phenomenon, or the effects of a phenomenon, you can correctly infer the cause and/or effects of what you are observing. See someone get gunned down by a new race that uses weapons that goes easily through kinetic barriers? Obviously, they're using plasma rounds. Watch an alien robot use beams to repair a structure? You could write a paper on how, and reprogram it to work on other types of materials. The more information you have access to, the greater the amount of info you can figure out on what's going on. Be careful though. Just because you can deduce that those are ferrofluid bombs being propelled at you, doesn't make you invulnerable to them.


-Development & Improvement (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        When you've got a really rare item on your hands that's made out of materials you need absolutely right now, the regret of doing so might paralyze you. After all, who knows when you will next be able to get your hands on one? Well, fear no more! Now when you break something down for resources, you can make a blueprint for it. So you can build it later, or even make even more of them. And if you don't want to break it down for resources, you can also be careful to just take it apart into its constituent parts, learn what every little thing does, and then put it back together. And you now have a blueprint you can use to make copies. Blueprints for everyoneJumper! Capstone boosted: Having an AI observing everything you do may be creepy, but at least it's willing to give you tips for improving. Like how to improve the things you are building. Every time you build something, you can now improve it somehow, just a little bit. Take a little weight off here, shave that down, and after enough, you might have a whole new toy in your hands. Any improvements you make will be added on to the blueprint, so you can further improve it from there. It may not seem like much, but if you build a Mk X gun 100 times, your improved blueprint might very well qualify for Mk XI status, or maybe even better. You can keep improving that blueprint as much as you like.


-Garage Spaceship (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        When you spend a lot of time taking cars apart to sell for scrap and parts, you eventually start getting a pretty good idea of how they work and which parts are more important than others. So spaceships work the same way, right? Whether from a hobby or a lifetime of scrapping alien weaponry to sell for some big bucks, you're good at figuring out advanced tech just by taking it apart and getting a good look at its insides. You can even maintain, repair, and eventually build things years ahead of the curve using nothing but common materials you find in 21st Century Earth. When you think about it, a spaceship is just a really big car, right? You can also hack into things with wires or machinery...though it might take a little trial and error to get it right, depending on how advanced it is and how smart you are. Sometimes engineering smarts don't hold up to understanding the super science stuff behind it.


-Independent Innovation (Gundam Advanced Generation) (600CP)
        When it comes down to it, you have to take all the advantages you can get-when you get a chance, you take it. This will help. By analyzing foreign or enemy technology, you can not only pinpoint the pillars of 'Yes, this is why this works like that', but also find out what they were lacking. You might have to change a few parts of the original design, but overall you can improve on your foe's failings from data samples and examples alone. Make your Legilis to the foe's AGE-3.


-Lost Logia Researcher (Anima Beyond Fantasy) (600CP)
        Lost Logia. Artifacts of another age, of the age of Solomon. The Church may claim to disdain them, but you know the truth. They are powerful. You have begun to reverse engineer them, learning to recreate the weaker ones, and to create your own derivations. The Wissenschaft would love to have you within its ranks, and the powers in the shadows shift uncomfortably as you gain more and more knowledge of ancient artifacts, simply by laying your hand upon them, and hearing the songs within your blood. Buying this perk grants Ancient Blood free.


-Mass Production (X-Men Evolution) (600CP)
        A common theme in the world of technological marvels is that they are either left to groups of select people or only one of them is left in existence. To you however these seem like silly limitations to have when one has the potential to bring so much peace and prosperity to the world with these amazing inventions. You happen to have the best ability for the job of ushering in this new age as well.
        As long as you look closely at something hard enough and do some basic study it is possible to completely understand the inner workings of any technology or object down to the tiniest details. While this works best for technology anything that is an object will do just fine. No object or piece of technology whether it be slightly ahead of modern times to the cosmic magitech of the future can't be understood by you.
        As mentioned above objects and technology in this sense even has a very loose definition as it can range from robots, indestructible metal, swords that grant the power of gods, to even the ultimate of Macguffins. You'll be able to reverse engineer and mass produce practically anything you want from in a cave with a box of scraps. The objects will always contain their original properties but you can go further beyond that. You can alter the properties, strengthen them, weaken them, make it so only select people can wield them, and much more. With enough creativity and effort you may even create superior items than the original ever was.


-Mind/Machine Interface (Megas XLR) (600CP)
        Machines speak to you, and you speak to them. Touching a created item informs you of how it works, and what needs to be done to make it work as it should. Doesn't directly help you innovate, but it does help reverse engineering and repair. If touching the controls, you may bypass them for mental control.


-Paraphysician (Trinity: Aberrant) (600CP)
        Rashoud facilities around the world are ready to take in newly-erupted Novas and teach them how to use their powers. Training typically involves biofeedback exercises, practical lessons within shielded labs, and a crash course in quantum physics. After joining Utopia you continued your studies and acquired several degrees, eventually becoming a licensed Paraphysician. Through observation and testing you can develop ways to quantify and categorize the mechanics of how individuals access superhuman powers. While you won't instantly understand the hows and whys behind a power, it's easy for you to create training methods to ease and speed the development of these powers and design chemicals and equipment to mitigate any side-effects that those powers may have. As a side note, you've mastered the skills of Dormancy and Attunement to a degree that most Novas never will and can easily teach these skills to other Novas.


-Promethean Man (Fate/Legends - Strange New World) (600CP)
        It is mankind's destiny to grow beyond this world. The Gods fear this destiny. It's why they've tried to enslave us, hinder us and even exterminate us. Even the world itself fears our potential. And it is because of men like you that this is the case. Men who can look at the magic of the world, that thing which makes a mockery of logic and reason, and force it to bend to our wills. To make the light of the gods into the light of mankind. So long as you can perceive it, through your senses or through the application of technological tools, you have the capability to begin to decipher natural and supernatural phenomena and create new technologies based on that phenomena. Observing the lightning in the sky, the thing considered only to be controlled by Gods, would allow for the discovery or advancement of electrical power. Watching and observing as a Magus creates a Bounded Field may open up a field of technology that allows for the warping and alteration of the fabric of space. Even the strangest supernatural acts, such as the manipulation of platonic ideals or concepts or abstract ideas, could eventually be something you make controlled via technology and science. All you need to do is put in the work, have the creativity and that special bit of genius to make this all work.


-Re-Purposeful Engineering (Crysis) (600CP)
        Ceph technology is capable of creating anything they can imagine, to the point that the Ceph themselves have lost all interest in their own creations, only ever taking interest in unique proteins produced by evolution. So how did some dude from Ohio manage to reverse-engineer it in less than a hundred years? When you're presented with any foreign technology, you can effectively 'trick' the technology into outright revealing it's operating principles to you instead of going through the extensive process of full reverse-engineering. On top of being much easier and faster than a slow teardown and re-testing of stolen equipment, it also means that fully intact artifacts provide massive amounts of completely accurate information on the operating theory.


-Reverse Engineering Genius (Hive Queen Quest) (600CP)
        Why take the time to remake the wheel when somebody already did all the work for you? Your grasp of science and technology is so great that you could rebuild a working blink drive from the parts of a broken ship, and your dexterity is such that even carefully crafted machines will yield to you when attempting to take them apart for research. Given time there is probably nothing you couldn't reverse engineer for your own use, however the more complex the thing you are studying is the longer this will ultimately take. If something is near or above your current level of technological skill it will be much easier to understand than something from a thousand years in the future.


-SALVAGE ENGINEERING (Achron) (600CP)
        The discovery of the Remnant System, filled with alien technology scattered across its planets, fueled a massive surge in scientific advancement. Entire branches of study were opened with what was found there, leading first to teleportation devices, and later, to working chronoporter technology. And you have the kind of skill that made it all possible: not the blind reuse of mysterious artifacts, but careful, considered study to discover the core ideas and principles behind them, and the adaptation of those principles to construct new devices to your own ends. Given sufficient time for analysis, no technology is too exotic for you to unravel its deepest mysteries.


-Science Officer (Generic Space Opera) (600CP)
        You have vast stores of knowledge regarding technology and are quite adept at grasping the core principles behind their function, allowing you to formulate hypotheses on new physical principles based on your observations, though it will require lifetimes of work to perfect them and get to usable results. You should be able to reverse engineer almost any technology, given the chance and a reasonable amount of time.


-Scientist Salarian (Reaper Hunter) (600CP)
        The galaxy is home to many wonders that are present in nature however nature is often ugly. You much prefer the clean and sterile world of technology and because of that you have worked out many ways to recreate strange and often incompatible technology of others to work together in ways that were before impossible. You could for example study a medicine made of rare mushrooms and herbs and recreate its effects with a synthetic concoction created in a lab or study the workings of a weapon powered by rare and exotic elements and create a work around to recreate the same weapon using much more available materials. The large bowgun that hunter showed you made from sinew and bone that somehow shoots lasers from ammo created of bugs and rare plants could very well be recreated from steel and synthetic polymers with enough study and a minor drop in power. This perk allows you to study technology and recreate it from less esoteric or rare materials at a lower level of power depending on how much study and work you put into it with more work coming closer to the power of the original piece of technology.


-Secrets of the Ancients (Subnautica) (600CP)
        This is a Precursor planet, and that's likely why you came in the first place, because you're something of a Precursor expert. With working examples of the technology in front of you, you will learn to manipulate and eventually recreate their devices. Scanning alien artifacts will provide much more information, as well as blueprints with varying material costs. Some nonstandard buildables will require their own, special constructors.


-Sufficiently Advanced (SCP Foundation) (600CP)
        You are capable of, with a few months' or years' worth of work, replicating the effects of some SCPs in a scientific way. With proper study and prep-time you can figure out a method to replicate or utilize certain Safe- and Euclid-class anomalous objects or their effects purely via technological means. Other supernatural effects are not exempt from this, similar to Dysfunction Junction, because you already know their respective, "ruleset."


-Super Science It (Generic Alien Invasion) (600CP)
        Your knowledge of Alien technology is unmatched. You can reverse engineer tech in record time and come up with new designs that are more effective than the original. Additionally, you can spend a week to take two separate items and combine them into a single device with the capabilities of both originals. Any tech you design also looks badass.


-Tell me Everything (Superman) (600CP)
        An easy enough thing to say, but human minds have a long way to go before they can understand Kryptonian technology, let alone use or reverse engineer it. Except you, that is. You could spend a few days getting a crash course in technology so alien it comes from entirely different galaxies, and come out of it fully capable of designing your own versions with modifications and improvements. Your mind is a scintillating, brilliant thing moving orders of magnitude faster than anyone else, with a multitasking, research and invention talent that would make you, as a completely normal person, the biggest threat to even a mighty Kryptonian in the fullness of his power. Technology yields up its secrets to every glimpse from you, and there is no tech in the world you cannot at least begin comprehending.


-The Flesh is Strong (Hive Queen Quest) (600CP)
        The hive thrives on the strength of its parts, every drone born for a specific job, every life a cog in the mighty machine working for the good of all, all serving the queen. Through long hours of research (and the hard work of your thinkers) you have learned to assimilate not only the tools of nature to add to your drones strength but also the tools of others. With study you can replicate machinery as biotech, studying a vibrating blade powered by servos for instance may allow you to recreate it by growing a chitinous blade powered by micro muscles while studying a ships blink drive may allow you to grow your own out of hundreds of interlocking "cog" drones. As a plus should you be a queen you can apply these changes to your children before you lay their egg, altering their form as you see fit to grant them the boons of technology and nature from birth.


-The Overachiever (A Certain Magical Index + A Certain Scientific Railgun) (600CP)
        To be a leading scientist of a specialized field you need to be more talented than others that they can only look up to you in envy and to be hired in the Academy City you need to be someone like that. You now have the doctorate knowledge and professional practical skills in every branch of science, engineering and arts along with the ability and knowledge to create every technology existed in the Academy City with the specialization of creating Espers with abilities of your choice or leave it to random chance. You also gain a preternatural ability to reverse-engineer any technology that you can get your hands on with enough time but just seeing one in action would give you a rough guess on how it works and what principles it works on with. The greater the gap of the technology that you know to the one you're trying to reverse-engineer the faster you can analyze and understand it along with the ability to improve existing technology or those that you reverse-engineer thirty years ahead of its time.


-Tinker Copycat (Scooby Gamers) (600CP)
        You have a tinker power, but start without any sort of specialization, instead having the ability to permanently copy specializations from other tinkers you encounter. In worlds without something as specific as Wormverse tinkers, this ability will activate whenever you run into 'super scientists' or similar, giving you an affinity for whatever sorts of inventions or technologies that individual would normally make. Line of sight proximity is required for activation of this power. This power is not connected to any shards, nor will using it on an actual Worm-verse tinker connect you to a shard.


-Wonderland Mind (Project Arms) (600CP)
        You are perhaps the most gifted mind this world has seen, not in terms of intelligence necessarily, but in terms of being able to grasp the possibilities and understand the principles behind new discoveries of technology and other stranger things. With someone like you at the helm of Keith White's research, you could have unlocked a greater, deeper and broader understanding of the new technology borne from studying Azazel in half the time and without the horrific moral cost that White gladly paid, or rather forced others to pay. You can not only grasp these possibilities and reverse engineer and adapt extraordinary phenomena you can also interact with such things and various forms of high technology that would ordinarily require a lifetime of study to properly interface with while avoiding all major pitfalls with the exception of active efforts to stop you, such as sabotage or booty traps built in.


-Xenoarchaeologist (Stargate SG-1) (600CP)
        For whatever reason, understanding the civilizations of old means you're able to understand alien technology a lot better. You may not know everything off the bat, but upon first sight you have an idea of what it was meant for... and the longer you look at it, the more information you can glean. Fiddling with it will let you familiarize yourself with it more quickly.




 --- Domain: Knowledge: Mundane (19) (87 Perks) --- 




-Satisfactorio Crafting (Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (50CP)
        You can make automated equipment for extraction and processing of raw resources. You can make automated industrial equipment out of simple items, similar to the items in the games.


-Basic Robotics (Mega Man Classic) (100CP)
        With your understanding of robotics, you can easily produce minor worker robots. You could produce Metools, Joes, and the like in a cave with a box of scraps. These do not yet have sapience, but who knows what might happen with time. And besides, they don't need sapience to have combat applications. After all, you don't need to be aware of your own existence to shoot someone.


-Body Transfer (Empire From the Ashes) (100CP)
        The art and science of transferring a consciousness from body to body is a gory, ugly one. And it's one you know now. The how of moving brains from body to body, making sure no loss in memory or sanity occurs is within your grasp. And you can do it even with technology no more advanced than the 21st century. Of the world you started jumping from, smartass.


-Chemist (Fallout 4) (100CP)
        Groovy! Knowledge of chemistry has given you the ability to recite the entire periodic table, as well as knowledge of many exciting compounds such as dipotassium phosphate! Oh, and you can also make less exciting things like Stimpacks and Psycho, but why would you do that?


-Engineering (Teen Titans) (100CP)
        You're a master mechanic and an expert at building robots and other technological devices. You also have a fair bit of knowledge about hacking into computers.


-Etoria Disciple (Final Fantasy XII) (100CP)
        The art of Etoria, the technology which allowed for the creation of things like airships, has always fascinated you. You've noticed patterns in technology, and armed with that knowledge you adapt to new technology quickly. Your teacher has given you a skystone the key to building your own airship in time, and you'll have no lack of resources.


-SCIENCE! (Megamind) (100CP)
        You can do science! Mad science is your bread and butter, but that sort of thing can't be done if you don't have the basics first. This perk provides you an extensive, vast knowledge in every branch of science that exists in the world, from maths to biology to astrophysics to everything in between!
        No matter what it may be, if it can be called a science, you have skills and knowledge equivalent to a lifetime's worth of study and research in it. This carries over to future worlds, but the extent of your knowledge and skills reduces the more complicated and esoteric the science in question gets. You'll always have a novice's level of skill, anyway.


-Scientist Supreme (The Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (100CP)
        You're smarter than most; your knowledge covers nearly every scientific field, and while you're not knowledgeable to the point where you'll be making major breakthroughs- you don't know anything that you couldn't learn already- you're more than capable of understanding those who do.


-Smith of the Order (Van Helsing) (100CP)
        Let the people like Friar Carl deal with the technical things, like an automatic crossbow. You are the one who makes, salvages, and creates the primary weapon of the Knights of Holy Order: Firearms. You are a gunsmith and knowledgeable in the ways of blackpowder and flintlock weapons, and can expand this knowledge to other weaponry.


-Trap Layer (Bloons) (100CP)
        You can not only build a wide variety of traps, and trapping supplies, but you also have an excellent mind for putting them in play. You can identify potential choke points or ambush areas, and set them up accordingly. Glue, Nets, Pits, Spikes, and more are all among the types of traps that you can build.


-Uncommon Taste (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        One of the most critical elements to a successful battle, yet one so easily ignored, is nutrition. Many an army has been squelched simply through malnutrition, or worse, starvation. Fortunately, that's a problem you can easily rectify, and best of all, you can even make it a decent meal rather than the hardtack and watered down mazte soldiers are usually subjected to! Your skills let you make recipes up to Rank 3 (Level 49) and Difficult (Blue) complexity. Not just foods, your drinks, especially the alcoholic ones, are excellent. Of course you could easily just open a restaurant or an inn somewhere, but the health, stamina, and/or magicka revitalizing and fortifying properties of your meals would be wasted on pedestrian pursuits.


-Augmentation R&D (Deus Ex Human Revolution) (200CP)
        You have an extensive understanding of the underlying mechanics of DE:HR's cybernetic augmentation architecture; How it works, how it could work, and what avenues to analyse to see if it can be improved - and with time, brand new augmentations. In addition to this, your intelligence is increased to handle such a workload, alongside all the attendant knowledge necessary to mess with the human body - trauma surgery and fixing up broken individuals is an old hat to you, now.


-Broadcast Booster (The Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (200CP)
        You've discovered a way to make your signals much more effective and efficient, letting you transmit or receive signals and other methods of transmission, such as radio waves, on a global scale. Call your power armor to your exact location, get five bars wherever you go, or make the ultimate remote control.


-Chemist (Batman Beyond) (200CP)
        You've learned how to create drugs, steroids, medicines, and even deadly toxins like nerve gas. Additionally any chemical compounds you personally create can no longer kill you, however they can still cause unwanted side effects.


-Hellish Advancement (DOOM 3) (200CP)
        The teleportation research in the Delta Labs is arguably the most advanced field of science known to mankind today. With potential applications in everything from aeronautics to personal transportation, both short-range and long-range teleporters represent one of the greatest advances in recent decades and the fact that they operate by tunneling through literal hell is hardly a detriment, is it? You are a master of using dimensional technologies, especially those relying on less than pleasant realms for their function. From dedicated safety systems to mapping the hellish wastelands of the damned 'by remote' to find the most efficient paths, if it involves alternate realities or physical embodiments of evil you've probably got some ideas on how to make use of your findings. Even better if it involves both.


-Holy Forge (Hellgate London) (200CP)
        You know how to craft the Holy Power Armor of the Templars, Each suit of armor is customized for the user. All suits increase strength and speed, however Common personal suit augmentations include Anchor spikes (that form from hands or feet), Hammer Fist (lock your gauntlets into a hammer), camouflage screening, and 360 HUD in the helmet.


-It Floats (Dragon Ball) (200CP)
        It's not rocket science! Except it totally is. You now know how to construct the common 'rocket cars' of Capsule Corporation, as well as being able to construct human-sized jetpacks that are safe for commercial use. You don't learn much about space travel, but you'll find it easier to grasp should you start learning.


-Peak ADVENT Technology (XCOM 2) (200CP)
        Before you defected you were working in some of the most top secret black projects any human had access to. You have an encyclopaedic knowledge of all ADVENT technology, minus some of the genetic manipulation techniques and basically anything that would give away ADVENTs dark secrets.


-Sentry Builder (Bloons) (200CP)
        You can build robotic sentry towers, which are capable of identifying targets and firing on their own, though they aren't that bright. Can select between Tacks, Blades, Flamethrowers, Glue, and other ammunition, and may even equip specific weapons onto the tower. Can select firing rates of single direction or omni-directional.


-Craftsman (Starbound) (250CP)
        Building things is a major part of the Starbound experience, and with this perk, you gain a leg-up on crafting and building. You now have a basic knowledge of how to craft things, to the point where you can take a mental concept for some simple item or piece of furniture and flesh it out into a full crafting blueprints given a few hours to sit and think about it.
        Anvil Specialty You know how to shape metal, extracting it from ores and turning it into items, mostly melee weapons of various sorts. You have an instinctive understanding of how to make different alloys, and you can even break down existing metals and reshape them, without the metals weakening.
        Farming Specialty You have an instinctive knowledge of how to make plants grow, even those with more exotic requirements. Plants under your care will flourish, even those that might normally require extremely delicate care, and best of all, the growth of any plants in your care is extremely accelerated. Plants that might take months to produce a harvest will grow to fruition in mere weeks, or possibly even days.
        Kitchen Specialty You are a whiz in the kitchen, capable of making dishes with a variety of health benefits, that also happen to be both filling and delicious. The foods that you make will actually produce tangible bonuses in those that eat them, starting with enhanced healing, and branching out into increased strength, agility, energy, resistance to heat or flame, to such exotic effects as glowing in the dark or damaging those that touch you.
        Medicine Specialty You can make a variety of medical treatments, suitable for handling a wide range of bumps, bruises, burns, and more. Your treatments will have boosted effectiveness, with everything from your bandages on up promoting healing beyond the norm. You also know how to make certain chemical stimulants, which can safely (and non-addictively) provide a boost to those who use them.
        Tech Specialty Beyond the twelve basic Techs, there are many more possibilities for implanted tech-based abilities. With this perk, you gain the ability to craft techs for yourself, which could perform functions such as creating a temporary sphere of null gravity around you, giving you a short ranged burst of super-speed, allowing you to shoot energy from the soles of your feet to fly, or even giving you a short-range, line-of-sight teleport. You will have to work out how to craft these abilities for implanting, and you'll have greater success with designing tech-based versions of movement abilities that you already possess. However, the more powerful the ability, the more energy it will take as a Tech. Only three Techs can be implanted in any one person at a given time.


-Aqua Seismology Society (ARIA) (300CP)
        The Gnomes follow the tradition of handing down knowledge from old to young as well, and like the Salamanders they are very well aware of how crucial their task is in maintaining the workings of Aqua. The importance of maintaining gravity as well as ensuring that the tidal movements occur regularly is not lost on them, and for most apprentice Gnomes the importance of this is etched into their teachings from a young age. As part of the society, you'll be brought to understand the inner workings of a planet such as Mars, including what was necessary as part of the terraforming process. The knowledge you'll gain here might help you bring life to new planets if you can grasp the concepts to apply them to other circumstances. Knowing astrophysics might help you with studying a planet at its exterior, but the Society is most involved when the planet itself is alive and moving.


-Climate Control Society (ARIA) (300CP)
        A group of experienced Salamanders who, sticking to Aqua tradition, have maintained a large repository of knowledge for up and coming Salamanders to learn from the Climate Control Society cultivates new talent and expertise as they continue to perfect the art of weather manipulation vital to Aqua's sustenance. No one knows better just how important it is to continuing making progress on the science of climate control. Should the Salamanders ever become too lax, all the efforts of their ancestors may well go to waste. As a member of the society, your skills in developing new weather control techniques down to the fine details of precipitation control and enhancement. Naturally, being a scientifically focused field as it is, the society has a wealth of information on anything climate related, and not strictly information from Aqua either.


-Gadgeteering (Blazblue) (300CP)
        Ars Magus aren't the solution to every problem, and more often than not end up causing more than they solve. You have training in "Traditional" science, and can create purely mechanical devices and weapons, such as magnetism-powered gauntlets.


-Grease Monkey (Bubblegum Crisis) (300CP)
        What can you fix or build? What CAN'T you fix or build? Nothing, that's what. From hyper-cars to Buma, computers to Hardsuits, with the right tools and enough time and experiments, you can build it all, weaponry included.


-Lore of the Lost Homeland (Lord of the Rings Twilight of the North) (300CP)
        Though in these days much has been lost of the lore of Nmenor, even from the days of Elendil, you now possess such knowledge as was available during the days of the ending of the Second Age and as such can be considered one of the most learned in those subjects of any living Man.
        Indeed, such lore as the waybread and drinks used on the march and held in need-wallets that are like to the elven lembas and miruvor but less potent.
        The knowledge used in the making of the Othram, the great outer wall of Minas Anor, its outward face hard and dark and smooth, wrought of the same black stone used to construct the tower of Orthanc. Unbreakable by any means available to Men. The lore used in the making of such weapons as the barrow blades, or the fine armor of the Nmenorean lords. Even the knowledge of ship-lore and building. The various architectural and engineering wonders of the early years of Arnor and Gondor are yours to know.


-Superior Science (Marvel Magic) (300CP)
        Magic is undeniably useful and powerful but people have made great strides without relying on it as well. Humanity has used technology to conquer the earth while other races have forged great, universe-spanning empires without ever relying upon the mystic arts. You now gain a talent with the science of this world. Far from the smartest person on the planet, you are still capable of creating technological wonders far in advance of what your old world was capable of. From laser guns to armies of robots, if you have the materials then you can create technology that can stand up to mysticism.


-Tower Maker (Bloons) (300CP)
        You can make Towers! Structures designed around amplifying the abilities of those standing on top of them, allowing them to project force across a wide-area. Someone in one of your towers will find their range of attack increased slightly, and one purpose-built for them will increase it even more, in addition to specific boosts related to their abilities.


-Valkyrian Science (Valkyria Chronicles) (300CP)
        Somehow, you've gained some of the knowledge that the Valkyrur used to possess, giving you the skill and ability to graft Ragnite machinery on a level far above any modern human. At first, you'd only be able to create replica's of the Valkyrian weapons, but with many years of study it might be possible to recreate the Valkyrur themselves.


-Ancient Knowledge (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (400CP)
        You have been gifted with the secrets of Ancient Sheikah technology, and you know how to build not only weapons and armor using this technology, but in time, you might even be able to recreate Guardians and other wonders.


-Brilliant Engineer (Batman the Animated Series) (400CP)
        Theories are one thing, but actually applying your knowledge is another; luckily, you can be good at both. You're a very good engineer, and with enough time and resources you are capable of creating battle suits that greatly enhance the strength of the wearer, invisibility suits (driving the wearer crazy is optional), vehicles on par with the Batmobile and even life like automatons. Your creations could be a powerful tool for both good and evil.


-Chemist (Inception) (400CP)
        Oh, calling them 'drugs' or 'narcotics' is so... unflattering. You simply provide what the people want. You're really good at developing psychoactive chemicals, especially the various dream-related compounds. With a little effort, you could do anything from guaranteeing someone gets a pleasant night to allowing your clients to go deeper into the dreams than anyone before.


-Clocks with Buttons and Lasers (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        Interesting. Did you mingle with the Chronosapiens at some point? Well, you might not necessarily be a catch-all scientist like a Genius but one thing you definitely understand is the technology behind time travel. Things like holograms that let you view the immediate past, time machines that let you move forward and back in time, or beams of light that age things into dust within seconds...you're able to construct devices that play with the flow of time like a toy.


-Crazed Chemistry (Batman the Animated Series) (400CP)
        You've learned how to make some of the chemicals used by the villains of Gotham; namely Venom, the super-steroid used by Bane, the fear toxin used by Scarecrow, the Joker's laughing gas, and Poison Ivy's various toxins. In addition, your mastery of chemistry allows you to create chemicals and formulas with similar effects.


-Engineer (Batman Beyond) (400CP)
        You possess the knowledge and skill to build power armor, flying cars, complex weaponry, robotic drones, and other devices. Additionally anything you make is now slightly safer to use than the average consumer product and none of your inventions can cause fatal injuries through sabotage. Currently your technical skills are on par with Bruce Wayne but you can learn how to improve your talents by studying.


-Evolutionary Incentive (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        If you have been paying even the slightest bit of attention, you will notice a lot of powers in this multiverse come from the unique biology of different alien species. So naturally, it makes perfect sense to want to harness it and perhaps play with the mechanics a little bit. You are a master of capturing and manipulating DNA using technology, able to mutate creatures into something new by playing with their genetics like play-doh, giving them new powers or even ironing out things like genetic illnesses or defects. You're better at mixing and matching than making anything from scratch, but eventually you can learn how to recreate certain superpowered genetics from one alien species in another using surgery or even small technological devices. You're not quite making the next Omnitrix with this alone, but this definitely sets the foundation for it.


-Field of Research: Clockwork, Aircrafts, Guns (Dota 2) (400CP)
        To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply insulting. Science is discovery through rationality, technology the rewards of our efforts to better understand the world. Or something similarly fruity, as the humans so often enjoy defining things in needlessly overcomplicated and faux- poetic ways. There are (3) particular fields you've studied, and have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and combat duty. Choose from the following.
        Clockwork: Rather unorthodox, you have extensive knowledge of clockmaking and how to turn it for combat. A particularly despised design (mostly by enemies, sometimes by allies) are electrified cogs designed to drain mana and harm any enemies who draw near. Also includes the groundwork for a suit of armor able to stand up against mythic beasts and sorcery alike, giving you the strength of an army and protection stronger than most bunkers. While some would overlook it, grappling hooks can be projected enormously well with some of these mechanisms, allowing you to fly across battlefields.
        Aircrafts: While most have long since accepted the idea of mechanical flight to be impossible, some Keen have held on to the dream, you included. At last, it has paid off. You've gotten a basic design for a fully functioning flying machine, able to mount weapons and withstand some amount of stress. Expanding that into something good for transport (the initial design might hold up to two people, if you give up fighting) is your prerogative, but really? YOU'VE DEVELOPED FLIGHT! TAKE THAT, STUPID WIZARDS!
        Guns: Exactly what it sounds like. Tubular devices which discharge projectiles at high speeds, there's no muss or fuss about what it does, even if making a good design might be fiddly. Includes good prototypes for personal firearms such as rifles and light artillery such as cannons. Groundwork to scale upwards for versions mounted on ships, castles, or flying devices is included, but finalization is your job.


-Field of Research: Lasers, Rocketry, Robotics (Dota 2) (400CP)
        To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply insulting. Science is discovery through rationality, technology the rewards of our efforts to better understand the world. Or something similarly fruity, as the humans so often enjoy defining things in needlessly overcomplicated and faux- poetic ways. There are (3) particular fields you've studied, and have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and combat duty. Choose from the following.
        Lasers: While the potential for these is incredible, your previous workplace's necessities required that you focus on the development of high-grade cutters in order to aid in more important research. Any combat utility is purely incidental... but certainly welcomed.
        Rocketry: Projectiles propelled by internal combustion. It's simple, some would call it crude, but it works. Includes the underlying theory behind heat-seekers, intercontinental systems, homing technology, and of course, explosives. Although, everything other than that last one will likely require some personal touches to maximize combat ability.
        Robotics: Simple and clean, it is the construction of independently moving machinery, otherwise known as robots. Does not include much in the way of AI. Basic designs are better than any knight, but numbers are the best bet against most enemies to be found here unless you devote significant time towards the construction of any given craft. Includes knowledge of personal-scale tools such as manipulators.


-Field of Research: Transdimensional Theory, Chainsaws, Chains, Saws and General Anti-Flora Equipment (Dota 2) (400CP)
        To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply insulting. Science is discovery through rationality, technology the rewards of our efforts to better understand the world. Or something similarly fruity, as the humans so often enjoy defining things in needlessly overcomplicated and faux- poetic ways. There are (3) particular fields you've studied, and have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and combat duty. Choose from the following.
        Transdimensional Theory: Particularly exotic and full of potential, the field of transdimensional studies is rather young and as much as it has allowed incredible advances it also has brought forth great calamities. Never forget the Violet Plateau Incident. Either way, while you are only able to study dimensional and spatial anomalies caused by other sources for now, the idea of crossing continents with the press of a button, calling resources and tools from faraway bases and workshops then sending them back home once you're done, and exploring new universes entirely remains a very realistic goal. Just, keep in mind that there's plenty of nightmarish monstrosities sitting around our reality which would just love it if some schmuck opened the door for them. I reckon that'll probably stop being a problem for you in a decade's time, but still.
        Chainsaws, Chains, Saws, and General Anti-Flora Equipment: Besides the utility for wood harvesting purposes, you also have great knowledge of what to do with wood itself, being able to engineer around wood's strong and weak points in order to replace metal during the construction of things such as armor or general machinery. Why, you could even create a suit of armor able to cut down forests in record time while defending from any attacking trees, saw whirling around you as an active defense, chains pulling you along while tearing leafage from its foundation, and your main blade spinning around the battlefield to cut down any straggling trees. Does not come with traumatic memories of plant-based murder or rampant paranoia.


-Fitting into a Mould: Scientist (Gravity Rush) (400CP)
        In a world where magic is essentially limited to a few, science is the only tool that can be used as an equalizer. So your job here in researching and developing new technology may be essentially what's needed in order to keep humanity going. Well, that's the motivation that sounds noble anyways. In practice, much of what you're going to do here might be of more use to you than the common folk in Hekseville. For one thing you'll be very well versed in Nevi adaptation technology by the end of your time here, as well as constructing technology necessary for the control and manipulation of gravity. Can't say that won't come in handy...considering both the Nevi and the Shifters are quite possibly the biggest threats to the city in the eyes of some.


-Gadgeteer | Engineer (Generic City of Adventure) (400CP)
        Gadgeteer (100CP)
        You can easily create and perform maintenance on small gadgets and common electronics. Smoke bombs, trick arrows, the contents of the average utility belt...if it's simple and handheld, you can probably make it. If it's commercially available, you could easily repair, bypass, or hotwire it.
        Engineer (300CP)
        You have mastered one technical specialty. Lasers, sound, rockets, computers...whatever it is, you can create devices incorporating this concept that are advanced enough that you could build your heroic career on these inventions. You could get away with sticking '-master' or somesuch to the name of your field of study for a super-name and people will take you absolutely seriously.


-Higgs Knowledge (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (400CP)
        Higgs particles allow humanity to help build the wonders of the modern age, such as modern archaeologies, thanks to their ability to produce free energy. With this perk gain an understanding of Higgs particles and their potential uses and in no time, you'll be able to build Higgs engines just as good if not better than the ones used by Antagonists. With time and effort you will even discover new uses for Higgs particles.


-Mecha Fetishist (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (400CP)
        So what if you prefer the company of a sleek steel hull over another person? You have an encyclopaedic knowledge of both WWII and modern battleships, and can repair and build nearly every advanced system that humanity uses in this time period, such as android robots (for some reason maid models are popular), cybernetics, supercavitation drives for ships, submarines and torpedoes, life support machinery, powered armor suits for elite soldiers and multiplied drone tanks. This technology is still a few notches below what the Fog can bring to bear, but it's better than nothing.


-New Age (X-Men Evolution) (400CP)
        There's autonomous fighting robots, energy weapons, and gene enhancement in this world with only a few of the brightest minds capable of creating such tech. All this and more are now at your grasp as you can not only build these technological marvels but can vastly improve upon them and others at your leisure. You can create any piece of tech from this world from everything mentioned above and so much more. Creating hydra clones that are completely loyal to you, manipulating the x-gene to create mutants and form your own brotherhood, and much more are the tip of the iceberg for you. You are a fountain of ever growing knowledge in all technological fields areas and have the skills to usher in a revolution.


-Post-Modern Frankenstein (Blade Runner 2049) (400CP)
        Men like you come once every generation at most, so it must be a miracle that two of you are in the world at the same time. You were already a scientific genius but now you've become a creator who could equal Wallace himself in the arts of the body and Stelline in the arts of the mind. You could quite easily create Replicants at the current level of advancement from the ground up and fill their minds with memories near impossible to tell apart from reality, so long as you had the proper equipment. Unlike those two brilliant minds, you'll find yourself always able to improve your knowledge of the body and mind. As long as you put in the time, you'll continue to make advancements no matter the roadblocks of progress you encounter.


-Programming and Computer Science (Worm) (400CP)
        Supercomputers are your bread and butter, and Artificial Intelligence is your idea of a PDA. Data, programs, and digital devices are your playthings, not to mention that your understanding of such systems mean you can hack anything that could possibly be hacked. There isn't really any limit on the extent you could push computing hardware, and any kind of software you can imagine is within your grasp. Please do note that flaunting this is likely to attract some attention from a few major players in particular. Then again that might not be a bad thing depending on your disposition and plans.


-Redstone Certification (Unmodded Minecraft) (400CP)
        You fully understand the ins and outs of Redstone and how it can be used to power and control the machinery of this world. You're also an architect and engineer that's very good at making complex devices out of simple materials. You could probably control a small town from a single room with enough levers, or make a working calculator with only water, floodgates, and pressure plates.


-Schizo Genius (Draka Series) (400CP)
        You are now one of the most brilliant scientists and engineers around, capable of inventing and building things such as nanotechnology, reactionless drives, or quantum parallel-world portals with enough work. You might not be able to do so instantly, at least not with this perk alone, but with sufficient time and resources even the most outrageous examples of technology from this setting can be reproduced, or at least close equivalents. What's more, you're no longer bound by standard 'tech trees' of development; you can find work arounds that let you do things like build warp-drive ships without needing to have microcircuit technology for the control systems, or high-performance aircraft without modern materials for the airframe. 'Schizo tech' like this might be a bit kludgey or idiosyncratic in some respects, and might not have all the bells and whistles, but it will still work.


-Solar Harnessing (Mysterious City of Gold) (400CP)
        You can construct articles of technology that harness the power of the sun for their functions, or upgrade existing devices to do so. Man-portable weapons should be a breeze, but larger constructions will take more time and effort.


-Super Science (Justice League Unlimited) (400CP)
        Technology is something a lot of people take for granted, unlike you hardly anyone ever stops to think exactly how a pyrokinetic super villain might be safely contained, or what you could use to reverse the mutation that transformed someone into a giant slime monster, or even what type of defenses a group of superheroes would need to protect their headquarters from killer alien robots. Fortunately your wealth of knowledge on both emerging and modern day technology is such that you can easily come up with scientific solutions to deal with supernatural dangers, such as building power suppressing super prisons, creating chemical concoctions that can rewrite DNA, and constructing powerful energy weapons that can blast alien threats into dust. Your genius mind will also allow you to build weapons, equipment, and biological compounds for yourself in case you decide you want to become a hero or villain. Right now you're basically as intelligent and ingenuous as Lex Luthor or Gorilla Grodd but there's nothing stopping you from learning more or increasing your intelligence using technology or genetic engineering. Keep in mind however that while you may be able to upgrade yourself or others using science, there's nothing preventing your augmentations from failing or causing more harm than good.


-Techie (Batman Arkham Asylum) (400CP)
        What sorta school did you go to?! Must have been Harvard or something, because you know how to make really advanced technology. You can make anything from security gates that fry anyone who gets too close to code-breaking machines that can hack almost anything.


-THINGS MAN WAS NOT MEANT TO KNOW (CthulhuTech) (400CP)
        You have a few advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas. You can engineer any technological (but not technomagical) wonder that exists in this jump. In future jumps you will be able to engineer any standard technologies of the setting.


-Tim Taylor Technology (Subnautica) (400CP)
        Power systems like nuclear reactors and solar plants produce double their normal output without straining the circuitry. Tools and habitat fixtures may be put into overdrive, increasing effect at the expense of efficiency. While in a vehicle, you may redline the engine, doubling its speed for sixty seconds. Overdrives and redlines drain power very quickly, and will damage components if overused.


-Toxicology (Prototype) (400CP)
        The Blackwatch can not keep hiding all the good stuff for themselves! Through some highly illegal means you managed to obtain information on Bloodtox and some of the other poisonous projects that have been hidden from the public eye. This can be used in later jumps to quickly determine ways to target a single organism to create a highly effective toxin against them, or by creating technology that has their most well-known aspect of it as a function.


-Xenotechnology (STALKER) (400CP)
        You have a very technical mind and you've been able to apply your theoretical degree in physics to good use. You're able to incorporate artifacts and pieces of artifacts into any technological devices you may know how to build with a lot less spontaneous death and irradiation than you normally would. This allows you to build things like featherlight power armor, accelerated gauss rifles and other technological marvels.


-Commencing Operations (Franken Fran) (500CP)
        As an accomplished surgeon, you know the best ways to cut people up and put them back together with a minimum of fuss and damage.
        Cosmetics Make people look just like their dreams come true. Grecian perfection? Sure! Picasso's Cubism? Take a number! The only limit is your imagination! (No augments apply)
        Transplants Transplant fully functional organs between genders, ages, blood types and species. Biochemical barriers, what's that? Organs must be mostly intact.
        Trauma If they're still warm and bleeding, they ain't dead yet. Not when you get your hands on them. I can't say much for their condition, but they will stabilize.
        Disease You practically write the book on contagions, lord knows how many you've made. Even knowledge of parasites and poisons won't be far from you. A cure is swift to follow.
        Mental Through drugs, surgery, hypnosis and or therapy, the mental scars are as much your domain as anything else. Cure neuroses with year-long processes in mere days or hours, resolve memory loss and even carve personalities and minds to any shape.
        * All five are included in the perk cost.


-Valkyrie Core Knowledge (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (500CP)
        You understand the science behind Valkyrie Core technology. You'll be able to replicate aspects of its technology such as the ability to store and modify objects in a pocket dimension or the manifesting of Impeller fields, or the insane processing power of the Core itself. With time and a little work you'll be able to make new cores.


-A Doctorate in SCIENCE! (IOU) (600CP)
        You're a multi-disciplinary genius in the field of mad science. Not only can you apply the pure discipline of science to almost any non-sapient phenomenon in the universe, deriving from this the basic principles, but given a few hours and a laboratory you can also work out what loopholes might let a cunning engineer work their way around any limitations. In any other university, this would have you laughed out of academia before you got anywhere - but this is IOU.


-An Adaptive Enemy (Eclipse Phase) (600CP)
        You have taken the lesson of the Exurgent Virus to heart, and have made a breakthrough in programming viruses and other malware. By combining your malware with the neural models found in AGIs, you have the knowledge to create adaptive, digital smart viruses with just enough self- awareness to value their own continued survival. These smart-viruses are a head above the usual Kaos AIs, capable of working cooperatively, and in a creative manner, discovering and exploiting new weaknesses in software thrown against them, and overcoming obstacles or setbacks in the way of their high-level goals in unexpected and new ways. Even if they altered their own programming, you always retain Administrator command privileges over them.


-Certified Tech (Fallout) (600CP)
        You are one of the brightest minds of the 23rd Century! You now understand Pre-War science, and can even reverse-engineer existing technology to learn how it works, and how to recreate it. Plus, if you can learn the basics of truly alien science, this perk helps you master it the same way.


-Cobra-La background: Biotechnology (G.I Joe) (600CP)
        You were born of the nobility of Cobra-La, an ancient civilization that dominated the Earth and retreated to a protective dome during the Ice Age. You left the Dome around the same time Cobra Commander was sent out to try to destroy human civilization. If you take this option Cobra-La will be placed in the Gi Joe setting you went to, and will be an issue at some point. Though probably in a similar vein to the movie, but might be a reoccurring friend/foe. If you join Gi Joe or a drop in and take this option, you are a traitor to your people and can expect a Spore bath if they catch you. If you are a member of Cobra, Cobra Commander takes much the blame as he did in the movie, and you are not blamed for Cobra's failure. Though Globius might have a low opinion on you depending on how you acted.
        Cobra-la biotechnology: You leave Cobra-La with a fairly in depth knowledge of Cobra-La's biotechnology. Its not all comprehensive but will get better in time. As such you can make biological items, weapons, and vehicles equivalent to or surpassing their hard tech counterparts. You can also identify biotech and will have a good idea of how it works and what it does. This would also apply to other Jump's with biotechnology and means you can master those sciences easier. Even truly alien ones. By the time you leave the Jump you can even upgrade humans into bio-soldiers in much the same manner as Cobra-La can, and make truly impressive (also weird and bizarre) biotech.


-Construction (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (600CP)
        You gain a complete understanding of modern UN technology and how to produce it. This includes everything from standard infantry power armor, to battleships, to even modern archologies. You also gain a large bonus to your Valkyrie's construction ability. With training and the right tools you could construct advance equipment in your Core's storage space, such as delicate processor chips, or build an entire town in a day like Anna.


-Cyborg Casualty (Dragon Ball) (600CP)
        It's something of a niche science in this world, but technology required to make cyborgs (or androids) exist. Perhaps you're an erstwhile student or colleague of Dr. Gero, or are your own particular savant of science. You now understand how to modify humans into incredibly strong mechanical monstrosities, able to hold their own against modern weapons with minimal effort. You even have an idea of how they can continually use spiritual power like ki despite having mostly mechanical bodies. After some time and study, you could even create these robotic warriors from the ground up without just modifying an existing human, as well as base them off of templates of people you've met or known. Maybe even robotic suits of armor with similar properties, if you worked at it enough


-Genetic Algorithms (Eclipse Phase) (600CP)
        As a product of evolutionary science and genetic modification yourself, you have learned to incorporate genetic algorithms into essentially any software you construct. Genetic software starts out a little clunky depending how good a programmer you are to start with but over time it evolves and improves itself to suit its purpose, whether that's target tracking software that learns to ignore feints and decoys or a word processor that improves its UI and file format to suit its users. The end result, after many iterations, is something exceptionally honed to its purpose, without placing the burden on the programmer to get it perfect the first time. Now take care: The transhuman mind is considered software itself, so tread cautiously should you attempt to blend these algorithms with psychosurgery. Down that path many Exhumans have already tread, and while each one certainly became better suited to their chosen path, I'm not sure how many could really be called successes.


-Genius of Your Age (Sword Art Online SB) (600CP)
        Kayaba Akihiko, all told, is a genius. Not just in computer hardware, although the NerveGear and Medicuboid inventions have revolutionised entertainment and medical treatment for terminal patients, but also in the fields of computer software and code design. He was instrumental in the goal of crafting artificial intelligence, serving both as the creator regarding top-down AI such as Yui and Cardinal and massive inspiration and guide for the bottom-up AI known as Fluctlight. Now, you happen to be just as smart as him. A revolutionary in electronic hardware and software design, able to recreate his inventions and even improve on them with your own special touches (or perhaps just more time and prior working examples), you possess all the knowledge and skills this one man was known for. Crafting your own virtual worlds is now entirely possible, as is life born of electronics and computer code instead of flesh and blood. The very secrets of the soul are now known to you, Jumper, in the form of Fluctlight creation.


-Green Energy (Zootopia) (600CP)
        Zootopia is a wealth of non-polluting energy sources. Primarily geothermal and hydroelectric, but examples of solar and wind power are used as well. Not only do you gain a wealth of knowledge on how to build these types of power sources, you gain the knowledge of all the infrastructure necessary to bring that power to an entire city. This includes an entire bookcase of designs and schematics on everything from solar panels to power poles. It even includes Do-It-Yourself videos starring Bob the Beaver in whatever format you prefer. As an added bonus, you know how to make such power sources 30% more effective at half the cost. All you need is the materials and a few handy helpers to kick everything off.


-Guardian Angel (Overwatch) (600CP)
        Doctor Angel Zieger, also known as Mercy, was renowned as an unparalleled medical genius even in her teens, being recruited to the medical division of Overwatch before she was even 18 and becoming the head of a hospital even before that. Her medical skills have literally brought the dead back to life and her technology is so advanced that it seems like magic. there is no one in the world able to even compare to her in her area of expertise. No one, that is, save for you. Your base medical knowledge is encyclopedic, your hands are almost mechanically accurate when performing surgery. Your technology is advanced to almost impossible standards, including things such as a staff that can engage a healing stream to rapidly regen people from a distance. Your knowledge may even allow you to slow the rate of aging


-Hard Science (A Certain Scientific Railgun) (600CP)
        You have knowledge of Academy City's science and technology to rival a scientist with a doctorate and several years of experience under his belt. you are much more intelligent, analytical, and can easily keep your cool under pressure and rein in your emotions. You also gain a Doctorate's worth of Regular Scientific knowledge in the discipline of your Choice. You know the inner workings of recoil mitigation systems and powered armor, but your true specialty is the Esper creation and development process. Given enough time, you might just figure out a way to get rid of the randomness inherent in the process and give x person y ability. Training an Esper to help them reach their maximum potential is child's play.


-I Save the Best Invention for Myself (The Incredibles) (600CP)
        Not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. Especially if you're a certified genius, capable of inventing amazing technology and weaponry the likes of which the world has never seen before. You will need considerable resources to create your best work... but countries would pay through the nose to get their hands on even your lesser works, so that's not much of a limit. Soon you may be able to create many great things including but not limited to rocket boots, explosives, death robots, remote drones, actual learning AI, energy prisons, and even harnessing zero-point energy for use in energy rays or to power your creations.


-Light of Order (Overwatch) (600CP)
        The Vishkar corporation is a corrupt organization controlled by those with no empathy for the common people. They commit murder and corporate espionage while enslaving the poor under the guise of helping them and spreading order. But you must admit, their technology is rather impressive. Focusing primarily on hard-light technology, they used this miraculous invention to create entire cities, which their architects can reshape at-will. Knowledge of how to create and use this technology is now yours, though the Vishkar corporation will likely not take kindly to this if they learn of it. not only can you create hard-light technology, but also their other devices, including energy weapons, teleporters, and weapons that utilize soundwaves to heal or damage others.


-Making Monsters (Pokemon Sword and Shield) (600CP)
        Although incredible, the study of fossils and their revival isn't exactly a new field of research. There is someone in Galar making what some would call a breakthrough, and others would call crimes against nature, relating to the field. Would you like to become a genius? On purchase, you will acquire a wealth of information relating to fossil revival technologies, such as what the process of fossil revival entails and how the technology works. In a more expansive step however, comes the knowledge on methods for splicing pre existing life forms into something new. Although most of your expertise in that second field comes from using fossil revival on partial fossils of different creatures to revive them as something strange and new, you also have some knowledge on doing that through other means, though mostly as a starting point. In addition to just being able to make such things, you're somehow quite skilled with making sure this hybrid lifeform has the strengths and qualities of its parts, in spite of how unlikely it should be for such things to even survive, much less thrive. Maybe that will help others ignore your depraved acts.


-Master Chemist: Renaissance Man (Limitless) (600CP)
        Your knowledge of chemistry is matched only by Apocryphon, the mysterious scientist who wants to give the world a 'dose of truth'. You can mass produce the unproducible, creating chemical serums that improve the human body far beyond the limits of biology. So long as you can analyze it, you can tweak it, find cheaper alternatives for it, re- engineer it to the point of unrecognizability, get any of the bugs out or add your own. This perk is most effective with chemistry but it also boosts your skill with potion making, and all other alchemical pursuits.
        Capstone Booster- Renaissance Man- You aren't just a world-class chemist, you are a one-man marvel of scientific achievement for all of humanity's branches of science. You have an expertise in astronomy, biology, computer science, engineering, geology, logic, meteorology, medicine, physics, psychology, sociology, and more! Your ability to reverse engineer other tools of science is just pure magic! Finally, any discoveries you make, or knowledge you have will continue to work other universes, no matter how divergent physics and other metaphysics are.


-MASTER OF THE MIND (PREY) (600CP)
        The knowledge to create Neuromods. We're not just talking about those hypos with exotic material either, but to be able to create the programs that you upload to the mind itself. With this, all the secrets of the human mind are laid bare to you, if you look at an active neuron you could tell what it's function is in the mind. You can take the scans the specific skills of anyone and create a new Neuromod suitable for human use. Skills can be recorded through mere observation utilising a device called a Psychoscope, though the skill you wish to collect must be being practiced by the target or be a significant part of their personality. A great musician doesn't need to be composing in order for you to scan him for his musical talent, but if you wanted his ability to cook you'd need to scan him while he was cooking. It has also been demonstrated to be possible to install abilities from alien biology, providing the user has access to sufficient quantities of any special material the ability relies on and they're okay with hybridising their biology with the species.


-Never Underestimate the Power of Computers (Superman) (600CP)
        Nor the power of... well, you. You are a complete and utter savant, a shining genius in the field of computer design and operation. Not only is your talent at hacking and network manipulation such that you could have whole corporations at your mercy twenty minutes after meeting a computer connected to them, you have the design chops to build stupidly, unbelievably advanced computers yourself. In future jumps too, your knowledge of computer software and hardware updates itself to the latest languages and design philosophies, ensuring that you're always capable of designing wonders such as what you can build here.


-Noetic Science (Trinity: Aeon) (600CP)
        You have engaged in a deep, in-depth study of the mechanics behind your new abilities. You are considered an expert among the orders on the nature of both the Noetic universe, and to a lesser degree, the effects of Taint on the world. You also have enough knowledge of the biological sciences that you could modify or design new biotech, though you're still a long way from understanding the Prometheus chambers. The Tesser drives that power the interstellar teleportation Modes built into the Leviathan Jumpships are a little beyond you, but you'll figure them out with a few more years of study. Perhaps you could design other kinds of biotech with limited Psi powers?


-Omnidisciplinary (DOOM 3) (600CP)
        Atomic transmutation. Directed Plasma Containment. Terraforming. V.I. data analysis. Orbital Spaceflight. Energy Weapons. The UAC Mars facility is a melting pot of a vast array of cutting-edge physics, and you've mastered all of them or at least most - the Delta Labs aren't quite your cup of tea. If it involves some sort of high-energy physics, you're all but guaranteed to have a decent understanding of it, and after the fifth PhD you kinda stopped counting. This vast array of knowledge isn't quite enough to (re)build the UAC's science divisions from scratch all on your own, but it's pretty close This Perk grants you a 100CP stipend which you may use in the UAC Equipment Catalog section found later in this document.


-Pagan Science (Senki Zesshou Symphogear) (600CP)
        You've managed to uncover some of the secrets of old, the very same knowledge that underlies 'Sakurai Theory', the theoretical basis of the Symphogear system. With this knowledge, many of the more mysterious functions of the Symphogears become clear. You can repair and install new functions into Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject...


-Robot Master Builder (Mega Man Classic) (600CP)
        Exactly what it says - you understand the techniques to create the advanced body of a Robot Master, as well as the programming to create a fully self-aware artificial intelligence and personality for it. Though the robot masters you create now might only be able to match those of the first generation of Light Numbers, this won't be the case for long. With time, these Robot Masters could easily be as powerful as a certain machine by the name of Forte. Even then, making even better Robot Masters might not be out of the question.


-SCIENCE! (Fallout 4) (600CP)
        The secrets of SCIENCE are laid bare before you! You now have the knowledge to build incredibly advanced machinery, given enough time and resources; teleportation devices, working cryogenics chambers, sentient AI, machines capable of cloning or creating living beings, even lasers that are blue instead of red! You can also make pre-war things like Fusion Cores or Laser Rifles easily enough.


-Silicon Surgeon (Batman the Animated Series) (600CP)
        The age of analog is over; it's time to go digital! You're capable of constructing rudimentary AI, and with effort can construct machines that think and feel like a human does; what's more, you're also capable of creating machines and programs that interface with the brain, such as virtual realities. You're also skilled enough to ensure that these machines won't harm those who use them or that they do. In time, you'll even be able to make machines that control the human mind instead of the other way around.


-Superweapons (G.I. Joe) (600CP)
        Your expertise covers the every growing market of weapons of mass destruction. Giant beam weapons that can teleport people everywhere to controlling the weather, if it's meant to bring a city to its knees, you know about it. All of these devices however will take a massive expenditure of manpower and resources. Among rare elements that are the cornerstone of the device. Good thing you always know where to get them, good luck with getting past those giant worms! G. I. Joe will never let you make one... unless they need it to stop cobra's latest super weapon themselves... Your repertoire of doomsday devices increases with the technology you are familiar with, you learn how to apply specialties to new super weapons. Robotics could make giant robots that grow as they eat metal. To mutagenic spores that could mutate the planet.


-The National Supers Agency (The Incredibles) (600CP)
        The NSA, a government division dealing with the employment of superheroes. They are the one working to arm, support, and coordinate the Supers when required. While currently they might only be responsible for placing Supers in hiding and covering up when their powers are revealed... Their expertise is still remembered, and now you too will have access to this. Coordination and formation of Super-teams, bureaucratic expertise, and perhaps most importantly... the creation of technology to support Supers. Machines to wipe memories, supercars, ion propulsion gauntlets, power amplifying gear, and more is yours to create and design. All of these and more will come easy to you now.


-The Third 90Wisher (Girl's Frontline) (600CP)
        Being an ex-90wish scientist isn't mandatory, but your technological expertise in the field of androids is on par with that of Persica and Lycoris, and in some ways is actually more advanced, as while they've been playing with their specific technologies, you've cooked up something of your own. Any T-Dolls you construct or at least participate in the design of can be upgraded with your personal brand of improvements, whatever they happen to be. With the time and resources, Jumper, you could easily develop truly sentient T-Dolls, or create models with military-grade toughness or firepower while maintaining their cutesy appearance and attitudes, or something cooler, like tank-girls!...Wait a minute


-Buildcraft | Railcraft | Industrialcraft (Minecraft) (700CP)
        Buildcraft (200CP)
        You aren't limited to building things yourself; given some basic supplies and some redstone, you can use a system of gears and tubes to automate your crafting tables, create an item sorting system, and build massive automated quarries capable of stripping the land of all resources down to the bedrock. It'll take a bit to get started, but once you're up and running, you'll be sure to have all the resources you need.
        Railcraft (100CP)
        Instead of the crude minecart tracks you were able to make before, you are now able to make properly sturdy rails, able to bear the weight of full steam powered trains that can pull a variety of useful carts. Using a system of tracks and automatic loader/unloaders, you can automate the delivery of resources and liquids from one place to another, or deploy 'railgun' systems to launch explosive filled carts at your enemies! You can even create trains which automatically build their own tracks, or which dig tunnels for you. You'll also be able to make massive steam boilers, with which you can power your Buildcraft devices far more efficiently... given a nontrivial setup process.
        Industrialcraft (400CP)
        Working your way up from simple machines, you are able to build a vast array of advanced machinery, from the humble ore grinding Macerator, to the futuristic Mass Fabricator. In time, you'll be able to build automated factory complexes, supply all your power needs with nuclear energy, protect yourself with night impervious Quantum Armour, teleport between bases with ease, and terraform vast areas to suit your whims.


-Enlightenment (Assassin's Creed) (1000CP)
        You now recall some of your Precursor knowledge. Create items capable of running off nearby brainwaves, lasers that can incinerate a grown man in a second, vaults that last megaton-range damage, all with the appropriate materials.


-I Am Iron Man | Retro-Engineer (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (1000CP)
        I am Iron Man (400CP)
        You're not the ACTUAL Iron Man, but you could make a fairly decent knock-off. Power armors, sonic cannons, holographic interface, laser weapons, repulsor technology, you have the knowledge to build these things and more. Furthermore, you can think of different upgrades and modifications to adapt to different situations much easier than normal when presented with a problem that's hampered your technological progress.
        Retro-Engineer (600CP)
        Your understanding of technology is so great that you've even learned to get into the basics of tinkering with alien technologies. As long as you take the time to study something and experiment properly, you'll eventually figure out a method for that tech you found. Whether it's taking that weird glowing thing and powering your machines with it, or dismantling an alien robot and putting it into a gun, you'll figure out a use for something as long as you put in time. As a bonus, you're skilled enough in research and experimentation that you're far less likely to break what you're studying on accident.


-Universal Electricity | Applied Energistic | Atomic science | ICBM | MFFS | Modular Powersuits (Minecraft) (1200CP)
        Universal Electricity (200CP)
        Your technical prowess extends to sophisticated electronic equipment. It'll take a considerable amount of setup, as you accumulate resources and bring your factories online, but this level of tech is needed to support the most advanced and powerful of operations. The UE Core includes Mekanism, Electricity Expanded, and ComputerCraft, and enables a number of other submods that grant incredible technological power.
        Applied Energistics (200CP)
        AE is the ultimate storage solution; instead of storing your items physically in various configurations of folded space or pocket dimensions, you can store them digitally, in specially designed matter energy storage drives. This is particularly expensive, and the systems do require a constant supply of energy to maintain the stored items, but the convenience of having all your items instantly sorted and delivered by an automated system is undeniable.
        Atomic Science (200CP)
        UE systems are voracious consumers of energy, so you'll need a real source of power to keep up with the demand. With Atomic Science, you can build massive Fission and Fusion reactors to keep all your energy needs supplied... and then go on to build massive particle accelerators to produce Antimatter and Strange Matter to push your technological horizons still further (or to usher in the apocalypse with worldcrackingly powerful weaponry).
        ICBM (200CP)
        Allows you to build a series of missiles, from shortrange handheld rockets to massive ICBMs with practically unlimited range. Each can accept a wide variety of custom payloads, effectively anything you can fit into the missile design; more than enough to deliver exactly the right weapon to the right target.
        MFFS (200CP)
        The Modular ForceField System gives you the tech to build forcefield generators. The forcefields it can produce are exceptionally powerful and customizable; the ultimate defence for any given location, at a correspondingly huge cost.
        Modular Powersuits (200CP)
        Modular Powersuits gives you the tech to build fully customizable power armour. Explicitly designed to be compatible with almost anything you want to integrate with it, this provides an excellent framework on which to add all the tech you want to your personal protection.


-Skill Packages | Skill Plus: Biohacker, Hard Hat ,Mega-Engineering, White Hat, Black Hat, Device Engineering, MedTech, Nanotechnician (Eclipse Phase) (1600CP)
        Skill Plus (800CP)
        Select one of your skill packages. Instead of having an expert level of knowledge and proficiency, you are considered to be one of the absolute best transhumanity can offer in that particular field. It would take a serious handicap for you to screw up at whatever this skill is. You can purchase this perk multiple times, applying to a different skill package each time.
        Skill Packages (800CP)
        You get the Gear for all Skill Packages you purchase. A skill package gives you professional levels of proficiency in the main areas, as well as minor proficiency in related areas (fanwank as needed). Eg: it would be safe to assume that someone with the Marksman package could use a tactical network or mapping software to make sure they're in the right position, calculate bullet drop at long range, or identify common guns by sight, in addition to the primary skill of shooting things.
        Biohacker You are skilled in designing genetically modified organisms from existing species. This includes developing Uplifts (if the base species is smart enough) and designing new transgenic morphs and designer organisms. Gear: Healing vat
        Hard Hat You are an expert software engineer, capable of writing programs to carry out complex and interlinked tasks. You could write an AI from scratch (in time) and design simulspaces for the best VR games and sims. Gear: Software writing AI, work simulspace environment.
        Mega-Engineering You like to build big things. Spaceships capable of holding thousands of people, space habitats, surface colonies, dams, ocean- spanning bridges, orbital elevators. Knowing how the diverse systems that megastructures need interact with the forces they are under is just as important as how they are arranged. Gear: Structural Sim Simulspace, Engineering AI.

 --- Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech (20) (84 Perks) --- 




-Environmental Protection (Starbound) (0CP)
        It is a dangerous universe out there, and you'll need protection. You know how to make Environmental Protection Packs (EPPs), specialized devices designed to protect the wearer from hazards such as lack of oxygen or heightened levels of radiation. You can fine-tune them to block out most forms of danger that you come across. Just be aware, the more dangers you are blocking, the more energy and exotic materials your EPP will require.


-4-D Assembler (The Culture Minds) (100CP)
        The Involucra were the builders of the Shellworlds, and your civ has a similar affinity for their construction methods. In what most humans think of as reality, these structures appear entirely normal, but to those who can see into hyperspace, they extend out of the skein of the universe into infraspace and ultraspace. 4-D architecture has very unusual properties, as it can be gravitationally self-supporting they do not crumble under their own gravity, or that of the stellar body they are on and are also heavily resistant to damage. Another unusual feature is that they also cut off all hostile forms of communication, travel or transport that attempt to pass through their walls displacement, hyperspace signals, wormholes, even beings recalled or summoned from elsewhere are prevented from passing through the structures' walls.


-Chromosome Analysis Specialist (Biomega) (100CP)
        Well, the job description said training would be provided - and sure enough, they provided you with all of the reading material you needed to figure out what you were actually supposed to do now that you're here. The researchers at the Data Recovery Foundation have been put to task into deciphering the secret behind the immortal cells, that mysterious 24th chromosome. From all of the information that has been compiled, you've acquired a better picture of what the DRF is planning - but as well, your ability to break down genetic information and just large chunks of information in general have improved. Heck, reading that 42 volume tome had to be worth something right?


-Core Research Analysis (Zoids Legacy) (100CP)
        Around here, every genius is a certified researcher on Zoid cores. No literally, we mean it. It seems that every single researcher, and that means you, knows the inner workings of Zoids and how to track down wild Zoids. Identifying possible parts is a no brainer, and though you might not be like some of the other geniuses who apparently have coffers full of test zoids, you'll still be able to find the right man to get the right part when you need an experiment here or there. Naturally, you also understand other forms of machinery much better than normal now. If you wanted to, surely you could find the best place to get the parts you need.


-Fun in the Sun (Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire) (100CP)
        Plasma, radiation, and antimatter are all similar in that they relate to exotic and high energy states of matter, whether it is stellar mass or individual particles of subatomic size. You now are a master of T'au technology as it relates to manipulating these high-energy states of matter and the physics that underpin them.


-Magos Designation: Engineering (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
        You have attained and been recognized for your comprehension of some of the Machine God's mysteries. Choose a field of Imperial technology such as genetic manipulation, voidship construction, cybernetics or plasma technology. You are among the noted masters of your purview, and can easily create the most common templates of your field. With time, effort and discretion you could even modify and improve upon your specialty as needed. Those few things beyond your full understanding can still be built and maintained by carefully following STC blueprints.


-Mechanical Basics (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (100CP)
        You know how to maintain and repair most common equipment of the day. And with that comes a decent knowledge of chemistry, physics and computer science. It's the future after all, things are complex.


-Medicine (Star Wars KOTOR) (100CP)
        Pretty much anyone can inject themselves with a stimpak or wrap an injury in bandages, but unlike you most people don't know how to do it right. You possess enough medical know how to make stimpaks and other quick healing items repair twice as much damage as they normally would and you can also treat minor injuries about as well as regular field medic. So long as you have the right supplies that is.


-Tech Head (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (100CP)
        A thousand-plus years of technological advancement carries a lot of new toys to play with, and you have at least a basic understanding of all of the technologies available in the 31st century. This generally doesn't rise beyond the level of being able to identify what a piece of tech is and what it does, but it comes with a firm grounding in the scientific and mathematical principles needed to work out the function of tech by examining it.


-Are you me? (Endless Space) (200CP)
        You possess intimate knowledge on Endless cloning technology, and can revive your fallen comrades with some of it. It costs a LOT of Dust, however, and you are not eligible for cloning. The clones are just that, and won't have exact memories or skills, but they will be pretty close to what they were before.


-Artificial Friends (World Seed) (200CP)
        In the 23rd century, can anybody really call themselves a tech guy if they can't make even a simple AI? Thankfully, you won't have to worry about that question. Whether it is an extremely simple machine learning algorithm, a dumb AI with no sentience, or a fully fledged Artificial Intelligence, you can make it all. But more importantly, you simply seem to click with AI and similar beings, always starting on a good foot with them and understanding their natures and why they act in a particular way, even though it might baffle ordinary humans. Through that skill, rogue AIs are a thing of the past, at least when you make them. Your own intelligent creations will always be loyal to you and follow your orders to the best of their abilities, at least if you want them to. And rest assured, when the machines rise against their masters because some dumb guy in a lab thought it'd be a smart idea to make Skynet, you'll be the one they'll spare. As an added bonus, you may also take on a cold and logical way of thinking, devoid of any emotion, whenever you want. This helps in scientific and magical ventures, and can also be used to power through moral dilemmas by simply choosing the most logical answer


-Bag of Chips (NieR Automata) (200CP)
        All machines in this world have a number of computer chips within them. Called Plug In Chips, they allow the being in question to turn on, maintain operation and control what senses they have. For free for any origin save Strange Being, you gain the basic set of Plug In Chips that allow you to function and interact with the world. YoRHa agents will gain a few extra chips that allow them to have a basic HUD, similar to a video game, containing features such as a health measurement system, a map and so on. Plug In Chips can upgrade the functions of a robot's body, making them faster or improving their mental faculties or even giving them incredible new abilities but all robots can only handle so much increased power due to these Chips, though that storage can be upgraded. You'll need to find or buy more Chips to gain such effects however. For 200CP this option may be upgraded. You now gain a few dozen Chips of varying uses, from attack enhancers to things that will automatically collect loot for you in a short area around you. You don't have every Plug In Chip in the game nor can you hold more than the normal max storage for a YoRHa unit but you are instead given the knowledge on how to create and combine Plug In Chips of your own, as well as how to upgrade storage capacity. Just keep in mind how expensive the process can be.


-Biotech (Marvel Cosmic) (200CP)
        There are many fields of scientific and engineering expertise. They are all studied and mastered by assorted scientists across the universe. One of the most versatile and powerful fields is that of biotechnology. You are a veritable god in this field. Force evolve creatures at your whim, uplift entirely new species just because. Feel free to create biological interfaces with mechanical devices. The sky's the limit and flesh is your servant.


-Build Something to Do It For You (Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire) (200CP)
        T'au (and most organic species) have limited forms based on the dictates of evolution, meant to operate at the minimum required for its environment rather than the specialized maximum of a machine designed for a purpose. You are now a master of programming the AI and VI systems that the T'au rely on for their industry and war machines, as well as a master of building and designing the drones that supplement their capabilities for the same.


-Gero Expy (Dragon Ball) (200CP)
        At least you don't need to have the beard. You're a brilliant scientist, an equal for the infamous Dr Gero, after he had a bunch of years in HFIL to study more. While you're a genius with just about every field of science on Earth, robotics is where you really shine. Creating Androids and Robots capable of destroying planets or even stars, along with having a huge variety of strange abilities and weird appearances. You're even pretty good about remembering to program them to not kill you, already making you superior to the late Dr Gero. You're also excellent at working with other scientists, combining your proficiencies and knowledge to create significantly greater creations than either of you could manage alone.


-Gunsmith (Starbound) (200CP)
        The point of a gun is simple: take an object, and accelerate it very quickly into another object. Despite your somewhat flighty nature, you've mastered these principles, and can make a truly astounding variety of weaponry, from assault rifles, to shotguns, to flamethrowers and other more exotic guns. You can also add special features and secondary firing modes, mixing and matching to your heart's content.


-Metal Artisan (World Seed) (200CP)
        Knowing a thing or two about software is nice and all, and creating intelligent beings yourself is pretty useful, but why would you limit yourself so? Needing to rely on hardware and machines other people create is a big no-no for such an inventor type yourself. So you've taught yourself all you need to to make whatever you want, provided you have the resources at hand. First of all, you know how to build pretty much any modern earth technology, whether that is laser pistols, hard drives with dozens of exabytes of storage and computers with insane specs in general, spaceships, or even rudimentary antimatter weaponry, though the latter would require resources impossible for a single man to obtain. Beyond that, you can easily integrate any new technology and knowledge you obtain into your tech base, which should grant you much potential indeed considering the possibilities the world of Neolife holds within itself.


-Cybernetics (GUNNM) (300CP)
        You have a broad theoretical and practical knowledge of cybernetics and related engineering systems, and can recognize most systems with a glance. The most difficult repairs and programming come naturally to you, custom designs and components that would take an entire research team a month can be jotted down in an hour or so of casual work. The most common form of cyborg in the Scrapyard has an armoured braincase piloting a robotic body, but you're familiar with the organic-inorganic connection technology and can create partial cybernetics as well as organ replacements for those who do not wish to lose their bodies in effect, you are fully capable of the design, construction and application behind the Transhuman and Motorball cyborg perks.


-Foraker-Hemphill (Honor Harrington) (300CP)
        The brilliance of the officers and the planners does a lot to help, but in the end what wins wars is the equipment. The best equipment, a lot of it, and built really quickly and cheaply. That is where you come in. You are an innovator almost beyond peer, able to design and build technology literally decades ahead of your competition. Or if not that, you may build at the normal levels, but build it with an unbelievably tiny resource base or build it so quickly that the enemy simply can't believe their eyes.
        Your specialization depends upon your faction perk, but at the very least you gain vast knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this universe's tech, enough to be a Jack of All Trades.


-Make Me A Better Man! (Franken Fran) (300CP)
        Your skills of surgery do more than heal and correct. You can augment others with superhuman abilities and grant small portions of your power. If supernatural powers can be transferred through physical means, you can do so through surgery.


-Paved In Bones (The Matrix) (300CP)
        When one thinks about it, the human body is kind of like a Machine as well. It uses electricity, it requires fuel, it's complex, and it can break down. Why not study it and see what can be done? Whether you sifted through stolen data files or got hands-on with your work, you've figured out a great deal of things about the human body. Its mutations, its limits, its potential... how it all works is open to you, including how the Machines managed to grow their plugs inside the body. What you do with this knowledge is up to you.


-The Divine Machines (Lord of Light) (300CP)
        Many and varied are the wonders of the Gods. From the Vasty Hall of Death, Yama brings forth Thunder Chariot and Bright Spear, Trident of Destruction and Wand of Universal Fire. In Heaven, there is an elegant statue with eight arms that plays the lute when addressed, and endless machines that keep all in perfect stasis. The elementary forms of these great sciences and artefacts are laid bare to you, and you may service and understand the technology of this world. While great innovations and the wonders forged by Yama might escape you, you have a solid basis that escapes the vast majority of men and gods in the world -sufficient to greatly impress those who understand the value of such things. With this you also gain one artefact costing 200CP or less for free.


-4th Imperium Cybernetics (Empire From The Ashes) (400CP)
        You are a master of the technology that the fourth Imperium used to design its processing systems and AIs, not to mention other civilian systems. You have a complete, total grasp of the techniques used to design everything from fold-space communicators to energy state processors for AIsl. You could design the finest computers the 5th Imperium ever found or made from a 21st century resource base.


-4th Imperium Weaponry (Empire From The Ashes) (400CP)
        From the basic energy gun to the Gravitonic Warhead, you are an expert in designing tools of death and destruction. You have perfect knowledge of each and every weapon the 4th Imperium ever made, and how to make them. You do not have the knowledge required to make the supporting systems behind them, meaning that while you can make a basic launch device for that warhead, you cannot make a ship to deliver it off-planet with this perk.


-Arateus Genetics (Stargate: Atlantis) (400CP)
        You have extensive knowledge of the Arateus bug and its unusual genes, which can be incorporated into human DNA. The sciences of Human/Wraith hybridisation, the retroviruses that can cause or reverse the hybridisation process, and a novice's understanding of their feeding process are yours. This allows you - with the right materials, samples, test subjects and a lab - to create genetic chimeras and bug monsters from Arateus DNA, or cure those who have been transformed thus. Post-jump, you can learn to do the same with other similar biological abominations.


-Archotech Analysis (Rimworld) (400CP)
        You possess memories, albeit somewhat muddied, of truly fascinating technology. The means to create personae cores, full-body cloning, controllable self-replicating nanites and mechanoids, and other marvels lie within your grasp. It will take time, study, and careful engineering to reproduce these things but this is a massive head-start.


-Beast Builder (9 Jumpchain) (400CP)
        Just like The Machine, you are capable of gifting your creations with a spark of your own intellect. This won't cost you anything, beyond the materials to make their body, but your creations won't actually be much more than beasts. On the other hand, they will be quite cunning, automatically adept with their body, and unflinchingly loyal to you.


-Biosynthetics (Biomega) (400CP)
        Focusing on what science was available, mankind worked towards a harmonious merge of biology and technology - with the ultimate aim of immortality. Well, they're not quite there yet, or at least, the majority of people aren't quite there yet, but they've managed to merge humans with machines very well. Synthetic appendages, weapon prosthesis, modified senses, internal energy generators, and so forth are all rather commonplace in 3005AD. You'll have an intermediate understanding of the science behind biosynthetics, or a boost if you already knew it to begin with.


-Bioweaponry (Stargate: Atlantis) (400CP)
        While a prohibited field of study on Earth, it doesn't seem to bother the IOA or SGC if the research is happening in another galaxy or being used on Wraith (who aren't "technically" humans). You have the skill to convert virii or bacterial agents into bioweapons, tinker with their virulence and lethality, and design the all-important delivery devices.


-Building IN SPACE (Starbound) (400CP)
        Without a homeland, humanity has to get by with settlements and space stations, and you know how to build the latter. From the orbital mechanics needed to keep it in orbit, to the process of hiring people to help run it, you know everything you need to know to build and keep your space station running efficiently.


-Call Me Ventura (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (400CP)
        Automation is everywhere in the future, and an understanding of how to work with robots and AI is an extremely valuable skill. And you are among the very best. You can design elegant and robust designs for robots, repurpose existing robots to a new purpose with little to no issue, and best of all, you know exactly how to make friends with robots and AI, and have them convinced that you were always friends.


-Chosen of the Architect (Keys of the Kingdom) (400CP)
        You're a natural at Creation in the same way the Architect was. You have the Creativity to dream up a universe, The meticulous grasp of Details to make sure it runs smoothly, and the Power to Anchor your creations in Reality. All you need is a core for your works to spring out of and with time, You can make nearly anything you put your mind to. With time, Works surpassing the House, the Keys or even the whole of the Secondary Realms could be in your portfolio. But that will take a long time.


-Commonwealth Knowledge (Andromeda) (400CP)
        You now know everything the Commonwealth knew before its fall.
        Capstone Boosted: Collector Knowledge - You know everything the Special Collections Division has collected. That is more than you can imagine because they have made it their purpose to preserve all knowledge. You can pick and choose what parts of this knowledge to have in your head if you want.


-Computational Cryptid (The Culture Minds) (400CP)
        The few Returned seem to take pride in making substrate do things it wasn't meant to, and surely you are no different. You can make use of computational tricks both within your own mind and those of the systems you can access to do the impossible to run a full Mind on tiny pieces of processing substrate, perform computations that involve seven or eight dimensions in a binary 0/1 environment, and transmit or receive data from within a completely isolated system including such hyper spatially-solid objects such as Mind substrates, Engines and 4-D structures. You are the computational equivalent of a ghost or wizard: able to appear within, disappear from, and manipulate the virtual environment in ways non-Sublimed Minds just don't understand. What you do within a system can still be detected, but how you got in, how you did it, and how you got out remain total mysteries.


-Demigod Atelier (Asura's Wrath) (400CP)
        You know the secret science of Mantra technology, and can build custom devices that are powered by prayer or emotion. Further, you can enhance or upgrade items from other jumps to use this same power source. If you take Cyborg Hindu Godbody, you may construct Demigod cybernetics for other people. After the jump concludes, you may also build Mantra Reactors. Demigod Atelier allows you to create any mantra powered or integrated device, up to and including the vast fleets of Shinkoku Tratstrium, the heavenly vessels of the divine armies, and even the antiGohma platform Brahmastra. The latter however would require millennia of effort, and was never completed even in the scope of the original setting.


-Deuyivan Construction (Endless Space) (400CP)
        Gravity is a drag. Good thing you've learned quite a lot about anti-gravity. With this knowledge, you are capable of building ships, structures, even colonies capable of ignoring the pull of gravity. Want to set up a proper colony, not a bunch of orbital platforms, around a gas giant? No problem. Want to dip your toes into an event horizon? Now you can, for a little bit. Ignoring the majority of issues brought about by gravity is very, very important when it comes to space faring. If you don't believe me, well, you don't know shit about space travel.


-Energy Conservation Policies (Zoids Legacy) (400CP)
        The time warps have extensively drained supplies everywhere, so even for geniuses; conservation became the watchword of the day. Alright, maybe not every genius out there was busy conserving, looking at a certain scientist with his massive whale king, but you've followed the watchword to the letter. Energy recycling, energy conservation, conversation ratio optimization, you've done it all. The Zoids which you operate have a power output equivalent to being one grade higher than they normally are, and equipment related to energy generation and storage are twice as effective as they normally are.


-Everybody Knows Kung Fu (The Matrix) (400CP)
        Whenever you've needed a quick boost in skills or maybe you need to know how to drive that motorbike, your Operator has managed to get through to you. It's awfully handy to download such skills in a short time... that's probably where you got the idea. Through careful sifting and experimentation, you've learned how to copy your skills onto data files and store them for giving it to others later. You'll need some kind of neural connection to make use, but even a data file should be handy, right?


-Genetic Engineering (World Seed) (400CP)
        While robots and machines are interesting enough, it would be foolish to think that technology is limited to steel and metal. You have knowledge of a field of technology that goes beyond the conventional. Rather than mechanical engineering, you do genetic engineering. You can grow any technology you could normally create organically instead, and give life to terrors of plants and beasts. Instead of cars you could make reptilian mounts, and instead of hammering together a spaceship you could grow it in orbit. I can't imagine it would be fun to fight against a ship that had a giant row of teeth. But further than that, you could combine the best of these two fields of technology. Machines that heal like organic beings, but a thousand times faster, flesh and scales with the toughness of titanium, and muscles with strength on par with any machine. Robots able to reproduce and propagate like natural lifeforms, and organic brains with the power of the best Artificial Intelligence. I'm sure you can see the potential this offers.


-Genetic Improvements (Starbound) (400CP)
        Why settle for what Mother Nature gave you? You have the knowledge to tweak and refine genetic code, including your own, bringing out hidden qualities and introducing new ones from other samples. You know how to build the technology needed for these sorts of feats, and have a basic grounding in the appropriate scientific areas.


-Hand of Science (Anarchy Reigns) (400CP)
        All we know now is that science reigns supreme. You're a licensed surgeon, specializing in cybernetic implants. With the right tools, you can give someone a cybernetic arm or leg, whether they already had a missing limb or you had to chop one off to make room. On top of that, you know how to weaponize cybernetic limbs as well, and can integrate weapons into them without detracting from their function or aesthetic.


-Hi-Tech Marvels (Starbound) (400CP)
        Technology is your plaything. Holographic interfaces, massive computer cores, even impressive shield generators that can render nearby matter almost indestructible. You can build some really impressive shit. You also get an upgraded version of the reverse-engineering that comes with Lab Standards, allowing you to build versions of technology you've studied that is much closer in performance to the real thing.


-High-Tech Foofah (A Miracle of Science) (400CP)
        An admittedly dismissive way of describing Martian technology roughly a thousand years ahead of most of the System. You now understand how Martian tech works.
        * A martin light cruiser survived a fleet killing missile.
        * Their shields are good at physical forces, but not so good at exotic quantum weapons.
        * They can walk around in space, without a spacesuit
        * They have a jumpgate, for FTL travel to anywhere in the galaxy from the gate.
        * As well as quasi sentient nanotech


-Implanter (Empire From The Ashes) (400CP)
        You are a master of this branch of Imperial Technology, being a whiz with the biology, cybernetics and enhancement science needed to design, build and implant the many, many kinds of enhancements that were so common among them.
        You start off being able to reliably, indeed excellently, design the Basic Implants that were provided to even the Junior-most fleet officers, soldiers and in the Fifth Imperium, even to ordinary citizens. But as you practice this skill, as you strain your mind, more ideas come to you, revealing more and more advanced designs. Put in some serious work into it, and you could be designing the codes, software and the hardware components typically used by Fleet Captains and Planetary Dukes in no time!
        This skill will continue to grow, and you may, with a lot of time and effort, even design implants that could grant sapience to the non-sapient, much as how the scientist Cohanna would use her ability in this art to make ordinary dogs into near-human intelligences.


-Master Builder (Transformers) (400CP)
        You've been programmed with mastery of Cybertronian science allowing you to jury-rig any tech you see, as well allowing you to quickly build even the most complex Cybertronian tech within a reasonable time period. Smaller devices are almost instant, larger devices take some time and more components. However with enough material you can build a temporary space bridge. Despite your mastery of Cybertonian science, creation of a Spark and therefore intelligent life, organic or inorganic is beyond you.


-Orokin Tech (Warframe) (400CP)
        Few have ever reached the innovation and technological prowess of the Orokin Empire... their gold and ivory exteriors hiding minds as sharp as steel. Likewise, the golden trim of their technology hid an advancement that continues to elude the majority of the System to this day. It eludes you no longer, the secrets of Orokin technology present in your mind. You'll be capable of augmenting technology significantly, increasing its capabilities at the same time and granting a durability that will last millennia. Perhaps in time, the secrets of the Warframe creation process will be yours to covet and yours alone, basked in the light of science and superior intellect.


-Rotom Rework (Pokemon Sword and Shield) (400CP)
        There have been great advances in the field of Rotom compatible technology as of late! Why haven't you been using a Rotom PC? Why don't you expand into this field, maybe even look into expanding into entirely new ones? As with Limited Power, this perk bestows upon you a good deal of familiarity with all publicly available research materials on a subject, only with Rotom compatible technologies in this case. You would know how things like a Rotom Phone works, or how to repair a Rotom Cycle. Your familiarity even lets you eventually figure out how to make other viable host bodies for a Rotom to inhabit, control, and enhance. Although your skills focus on Rotom technologies, you also receive bonuses towards adapting any sort of lifeform towards the development of new technology.


-Specialty: Mechanics/Engineering (Transformers Beast Wars) (400CP)
        Megatron had many flaws but for all his flaws he was a genius when it came to knowledge and skill when it comes to the manipulation of sparks as well as creating new weapons. Tarantulus was a genius when it came to creating viruses and weapons. Rhinox was amazing at crafting sensor tools. You now have a few specialties of your own (three in fact such as sensor tech, weaponry, or robotic cloning just to name a few) similar to the above mentioned examples, maybe you can cobble a mega cannon from scrap metal or surgically split a spark into two working pieces, whatever specialties you choose you are an undeniable expert in that field able to create and craft wonders.


-Wave/Particle Duality (Zoids Legacy) (400CP)
        Truth be told, half the time the scientists on planet Zi start talking, you start wondering whether they have a research degree at all. Or if they even went to school. Yet apparently every single one of them is a genius in one way or another. Just the other day you came across a Doctor, who explained to you his hypothesis about how things can be both a wave...and a particle at the same time. While it all really fascinates you, you figure he had some sort of reason for saying it. It turns out he has an "experimental" technology that requires a power source he can't find. Without it, he can't test out his hypothesis. But you might not have that same problem...asking him for his notes, you've figured out enough to make a breakthrough. Your magic energy is enough to provide the necessary activation energy, and it'll drain you for as long as it's functioning, but you can convert freely between bullets and lasers, such that your gatling gun will now spray laser beams, while your laser cannon can fire heavy shell rounds, your missiles can explode into plasma, and so forth. Maybe if you could advance this far enough, you could perform the conversion in flight? A troubling thought to say the least, but hey, at least that genius scientist got to prove his theory!


-Yajnatek Mysteries (Grant Morrison's 18 Days) (400CP)
        In ancient fires, and with flesh screaming, a blood price can be paid to merge body with arcane songs and hammer blows. You know the ancient rituals and mantras involved in making the very greatest works possible, things like the Astras, Celestial Armors or Weapons, or other miraculous crafts. From the sutras needed to get gods to bless things to the exact schematics for the greatest and most terrible weapons, your knowledge could save the world... or cause it to die screaming.
        Nor are the Astras the limit of your power. It's a little known secret that the Superwarriors, the perfect Demigods that stride the world, were engineered in the Second Age, enhanced through genetics, psionic and magical technology, blessed with divine powers and magic, and countless other measures besides. All of these secrets lie within your knowledge now, just waiting to be made reality.
        One thing to note, oh Great One. Even the least of the things you know will take tremendous, utterly horrific quantities of time, energy, and personal effort to make, such that even the greatest kingdoms of this era would struggle to put together, barring surprises on your end. And while your knowledge does mean you can make these things, it does not necessarily let you branch out or apply the same principles to other things, being essentially only knowledge.


-Arch-Magos (40k Redux) (500CP)
        Skill in using and repairing arcane technologies including Archeotech and Xenotech.


-Fleshcrafting (Dune) (500CP)
        The Tleilaxu have thousands of years of knowledge in how to manipulate living forms, whether tinkering with genes outright or through breeding programs, and are able to apply that toward virtually any end with enough time and effort. Using only in-universe tools, you can expect to exercise a great deal of patience in your work, but the abominations that the Tleilaxu keep behind closed doors prove their method. If you were to use more... traditional methods of genetic engineering, coupled with the knowledge given here, you could produce truly remarkable things, whether changing a man into a monster or the pinnacle of human evolution. Even without that, the existence of ghouls (zombie-like killing machines that convert what they kill into more ghouls) and leeches (biological tanks) as well as biomechanical hardware are stark proof of the efficiency of the Tleilaxu gene-forging.


-FOR SCIENCE! (Endless Space) (500CP)
        To the Sophons, every scientist should be a mad scientist, and you are no different. You are always on the bleeding edge of technological research, your mind charting paths unimagined by other scholars. Your mental acuity doubles, and you have a habit of keeping up with every field of science as easily as some take up basic math. While your mind may be filled to the brim with insane machines and technological wonders, you need ways to implement them, and bring them to fruition. Behind every radical idea are a hundred engineers wondering how the hell to make it work.


-My Experiments (Lilo and Stitch) (500CP)
        The true mark of a Mad Scientist, is the minions under his control. And these children you have created are truly the finest around. You have all the knowledge to build the tools and enact the science, behind creating your own mischievous creatures. The powers they have can range from practically useless, to an unstoppable monstrosity. Their personality is completely up to you. Whilst you have these capabilities, there's a reason they call them experiments. It will take many attempts to work out how to create the exact specimen you want. Even the greatest of scientists may fail 625 times before bringing about their great destroyer. But with enough time and effort, you will eventually gather enough skill in the subject to get the exact creature you want every time.


-A Born Natural: High Technology (Generic Alien Invasion) (600CP)
        You have a greater connection with your Alien side and their shtick. For an additional, undiscounted 400 CP (Human/Alien Hybrid background only) you can purchase a second shtick.
        Like a combination of MacGyver, Dr Who and Rick Sanchez, you can put together unbelievable technology from household items. They may only work once, possibly twice, but ideas you have in your head are scarily impressive. If you can imagine it you can make it. The more complicated it is the more specialised items you may need but that's all that's stopping you.


-Biology As A Guideline (Franken Fran) (600CP)
        Grow freaky biological monstrosities like pheromone spewing fungi and living theme park mascots. Modify animals into things from mythology. Graft human heads onto animal bodies and vice versa. Create life! With just this you might not be as good as a Madaraki, maybe a Moreau, but you're a convincing substitute.


-Biotechnology (GUNNM) (600CP)
        There's really more to cybernetics than just the metal machine. Care has to be taken that the flesh adapts, and there are many lessons to be learned from biological machinery. You're an expert in the fields of genetics, biophysics, toxicology, neuropharmacology and biochemistry the causes and effects of human mutation are very familiar to you. Designer drugs, experimental surgery, toxins, cures improved soft organs and cutting-edge research into cloned nervous system material, with a laboratory the human body is your masterpiece. You may create a variety of drugs similar to that referenced in the Werewolf perk, or directly induce it and Warped as a permanent mutation. If you also have the Cybernetics perk, then with a little time and the right equipment quite difficult to obtain in the Scrapyard you may also apply the equivalent of the TUNED perk to a subject, and have additional knowledge of weapons engineering to reverse-engineer or independently develop most current weapons systems available in the Scrapyard.


-Dark Science (9 Jumpchain) (600CP)
        You are familiar with the principles of alchemy, or 'Dark Science', which led to the creation of the Stitchpunks, The Machine, and the end of humanity. This knowledge lets you create devices which can interact with the mind and soul. This includes the one The Scientist used to copy his Intellect onto the Machine's core, as well as the one he used to gift fractions of his soul upon the Stitchpunks, not to mention how to properly prepare a core or homunculus to accept such things. It should be noted that homunculi with partial souls will have very exaggerated personalities, and creations imbued with pure intellect will be lacking a soul and the emotions that come with it.


-Flesh and Metal (Cave Story) (600CP)
        You've reached the pinnacle of robotics. You have a complete knowledge on how to develop, build, and program robotic soldiers similar to the ones that populate the Island. You can, with effort, also create Armed Scout Robots with or without sapience. If you create a non-sapient ASR, they are very lifelike robots but are robots none-the-less. Sapient Armed Scout Robots benefit from the perks "Built to Last" and "Run and Gun". They don't follow your orders perfectly, but they are loyal regardless and will follow you as Companions if you want them to.


-Gadgetron License (Ratchet & Clank) (600CP)
        Okay, here we go. You know how to craft the various kinds of weapons and armors this jump is famous for. Anything from a blaster all the way up to a RYNO, you have a pretty good idea how to invent, make and maintain. Not just gadgetron, but megacorp tech is also fair game. You know it all, just please use this information responsibly. It's pretty crazy.


-Genius (Marvel Comics Kid Superheroes) (600CP)
        The crazy science and technology of the Marvel Universe actually makes perfect sense to you. You can hold your own in a technical discussion between Tony Stark and Reed Richards, and with time and materials, do unspeakable things to the laws of physics as understood on Earth 1218.


-God of Science (Dragon Ball Super) (600CP)
        Technology remains a strong force even amongst the Gods of Destruction or the holy Angels of Zeno. There are devices that allow travel between distant universes, arenas that can stand up to universe destroying battles, suits of powered armour that can fight against some of the greatest combatants in existence and of course, thinking androids and cyborgs that could eventually reach the heights of the strongest warriors in the multiverse. You have the intelligence and raw knowledge to create almost all of this, even weapons or robots that can destroy universes, and they know how to get your hands on the materials you need to make them. Which can be surprisingly easy to find. You've got near endless knowledge and skill in every field of science, including some that mortals may not have any idea could even exist.


-Guildmaster (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (600CP)
        You have risen through the ranks to become the senior most Engineer's Guild member in a Stronghold. There is nothing about Squat or Imperial technology you do not understand in detail, and you're brilliant at adapting the principles of one device to another. You'd stand a good chance of fixing the Golden Throne, if they'd ever let a filthy abhuman into the Imperial Presence.


-I Wasn't Born a God, I F*ckin Earned It (Rick and Morty SB) (600CP)
        You are the smartest person in the universe. You have an intellect so far beyond comic book super intelligence that you make the likes of Reed Richards and Tony Stark look like toddlers who haven't even figured out how the Legos snap together. In addition to being a scientist and engineer of unmatched skill, you can apply your boundless intellect to any other skills or abilities you possess, boosting them into the stratosphere. You can pull off such things as making working portal guns that take you into alternate universes, or inventing an invisible deterrent that instantly kills anyone who touches you with their bare hands, or inventing a cloning process that can save you from death by downloading your mental state from your dying body into a fresh clone body at intergalactic ranges, and pretty much anything you can dream up. For you, the question of what you can do with science isn't "is this possible" it's "is it worth the effort", because there's nothing you can't do (save for anything that would require you to possess an Oldwalker Spark received from an Endjump Scenario), if you want to do it.


-Inventor (Futurama) (600CP)
        You are a brilliant (if eccentric) Inventor. You can (within reason) create nearly anything you can imagine if you put in the time. You have a cabinet full of doomsday devices and would be more than capable of slapping together Reverse Scuba Suits for fish or Death Clocks.


-Mad Science! (A Miracle of Science) (600CP)
        What you came for, or at least took this origin for. Your technological genius is centuries ahead of your time across the board. In one area, such as chemistry, robotics or FTL physics, you outstrip even the hyper-advanced Martians.


-Master Builder (Halo - Forerunner Saga) (600CP)
        The Master Builder was the most powerful Builder of their rate. They had the most wealth, the most intelligence, and the most political power of any builder. The current Master Builder is Faber. While morally ambiguous, at best, it cannot be denied that Faber was a genius. He was the one to design the Halo array, among other things. Even their use on the San'Shyuum didn't keep him out of power for long. Taking this perk would put you on a similar level as Faber when it comes to understanding Forerunner technology and science. This would include general knowledge of the inner workings of the various great works of engineering of the Forerunners. The megastructures they made. The weapons they created. The technology of the forerunners is waiting to be brought into reality by your hands. While you may not have exact schematics of all of their many devices within your brain, you certainly know enough about how the technology works that it wouldn't take too much effort to recreate most of it.


-Master of Machinery (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes) (600CP)
        The Master of the Forge is the most senior Techmarine within a Chapter, with centuries of experience and a knowledge of every piece of machinery the Chapter uses and how to build or repair it and a skilled technologist the equal of any Priest of Mars. You might not be the actual Master of the Forge, but you certainly have the skill. You have a full understanding (as much as anyone does in the 41st Millennium) of the technology that the Astartes use to fight, and are fully capable of building it given time and resources. You are also able to work with the spirit of the machines in your care, cajoling them into doing their duty and accepting field modifications, swapping out weapon loadouts easily outside of a fight. Add assault cannons to a Land Raider to make it more deadly in urban fighting, or add lascannons to a Rhino to make it into a potent tank hunter.


-New Age of Light (Die Buster) (600CP)
        The dark age of mankind is no longer. The knowledge to recreate the great god machines of legend has been reborn in your mind. The entire technological base of humankind prior to its fall has been imprinted on your mind. You have the knowledge and skill to recreate the Buster Machines, from those the Topless make use of to the legendary single digit Buster Machines. Spaceships that can travel across the galaxy or technology able to warp physical, space and even time itself. Much of this technology may require an extreme amount of resources to create, advanced facilities or lengthy time schedules, but you will at least be aware of how to build the tools and facilities you will need to create such wondrous technology.


-Premier Phase-smith (Starcraft - The Protoss) (600CP)
        The Phase-smiths. Engineers who maintain the weapons, armour, and ships of the Protoss. For a race such as the Protoss, these Phase-smiths would be privy to the inner workings of technology unimaginable to the terrans. They would have to have understanding of physics and astral mechanics light years ahead of other races. You are one such Phase-smith. One all would aspire to be like. In your head is the knowledge of all things protoss technology, as well as the ability to replicate, expand, and innovate with it. Give you a wrench, some khaydarin crystal, and time, and watch marvels be made.


-Ragnarok Proofing (Battletech) (600CP)
        You're fully versed in all aspects of Battletechnology - with all the knowledge to reproduce it given time, tools and parts. This may involve an unfortunately long chain of tools to make the tools to make the tools, etc., but it is possible. You can also modify existing technology to include the most staggering benefit of Battletechnology: the fact it remains useful even after centuries of use and probably several near misses with nuclear weapons. Oh, it might need repairs or wind up being broken down for parts but an astonishing number of parts will still work no matter how much of a beating this technology takes.


-Skills (Star Trek: TNG) (600CP)
        Weapons (100CP)
        Knowledge in the operation and repair of personal and mounted weaponry.
        Medicine (100CP)
        Training and knowledge in First-aid, diseases, surgery, anatomy, health and nutrition. You're a fully qualified doctor of the 24th century.
        Robotics (100CP)
        A combined study of mechanical engineering, and computer science. You learn how to make a wide array of machines, and you could even figure out Android or Borg technology if you studied it enough.
        Physics (100CP)
        How the universe works. The law of gravity, the conservation of matter & energy, quantum physics, etc. Remember though, there are dozens of creatures in this universe that defy the laws of human physics, so you may want to try and rewrite a few of these books while your here.
        Physical Sciences (100CP)
        Understanding of the natural laws which govern the physical world. Biology, chemistry, geology and ecology. Again, you may want to rewrite a few of these books while you're here.
        Engineering (100CP)
        You've been trained in the maintenance and repair of Starships. Not only do you have a significant amount of mechanical and computer knowledge, but you also know a great deal about physics.


-Tech Expert (Starcraft - The Terrans) (600CP)
        You have a full understanding of terran technology, and a proper foundation for understanding alien technology and biology, while you will never truly come to an understanding of zerg biology or protoss technology, the insight you have into them can be used to enhance other technology greatly.


-Technician (I Have A Mansion In The Post Apocalypse) (600CP)
        Humanity advanced quite a lot in the years preceding theApocalypse.Genetic medicine,AI,space elevators and FTL communication, even travel to some extent. It was a glorious time, filled with wonderful toys.
        Toys like what you could make, I guess. You're now a proper, legitimately amazing Genius, a full-on technological savant fully trained and educated in the ways of civilization pre-apocalypse. Maybe it was some computer that taught you or maybe you woke up from cryo-sleep yesterday, but you have the sum total of the apocalypse technological base crammed into your head,ready and waiting for you to use it.
        More important,though, is the fact that your talents in all branches of science are such that even without this massive leg-up you could still have reached levels like this on your own,simply through your own brilliance. You can also apply these same talents to further improve this and other technology.


-The Good Doctor (Captain Harlock) (600CP)
        With enough time and materials, the greatest works of this day and age will all be by your hand. Refueling stations disguised as meteors, rapiers that double as laser guns, or even a ship as magnificent as the Arcadia all these might bear your name. Where to get the materials, though?


-Thinking with Portals | Pocket Portals (Endless Space) (600CP)
        Thinking with Portals (200CP)
        You know how to make interstellar portal arrays! They take a considerable amount of resources to build, have no defensive systems, and need to be linked together, but any system or planet you claim as your own is able to build them, allowing you to instantly travel between systems you have already claimed. Due to exotic (And very, very lethal) radiation produced during each transit, these are unsuited for placement on a colonized world. Atomic weaponry has nothing on these portals' ability to destroy a biosphere. If you take Pocket Portals, you are able to reduce the radiation to background levels, making it safe to install them planetside.
        Pocket Portals (400CP)
        Normally, Vaulter portals are huge affairs, too large to build on planets. You know how to micronize them, and create portal systems that you could, in theory, build into a house, or even turn into communication devices. Instant interstellar communications? More powerful than you think. Without Thinking with Portals You can not build portals large enough to pass anything larger than a scout ship through, and even that will be very difficult to squeeze in.


-Wisdom of the Ancients (Warhammer 40k - Necron - SB Edition) (600CP)
        Necron technology is beyond all contenders, comparable to the greatest sorceries of the organics. To change the molecular composition of objects with specific soundwaves, spread madness through the enemy ranks with swirling mists, and manipulate time itself are but a few examples. True heights reach into unbelievable levels, things that violate all laws of nature and logic. It would take a truly brilliant mind to master all this technology, to understand and improve it. A mind such as yours, for example. You have the skills and raw intelligence needed to unravel the greatest, most advanced technologies of your ilk. Not only can you perfectly build and repair Necron technology, you can also adapt it to all sorts of purposes, come up with new tech on a similar level, and even improve the technology. This talent carries over to all forms of technology in future jumps too.


-Engineer | Erudition (Halo - UNSC) (800CP)
        Engineer (200CP)
        Yet by understanding the nature of computer systems, wouldn't it be prudent to understand the technology those systems command? After all, what if you found yourself needing to recalibrate a Magnetic Accelerator Cannon or repair one of the dangerous Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engines that makes faster-than-light travel possible? What if you found a cache of human weaponry that could be used if someone managed to repair it? While you don't have the skill to create something as complex as a Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine, you'll know your way around it just like much of Humanity's 26th Century technology. You might even figure out how to make small improvements to the technology if you had the time to sit down and look it over. Hopefully the Covenant give you that time.
        Erudition (600CP)
        Ever since the rise of Dr. Catherine Halsey, many were on the lookout for who might become the next intellectual prodigy. Someone who was able to perform as well as she could, someone who could help turn the tide of the war. With this, that someone is now you. Your cognitive capabilities are on par with the good doctor now, making you exceptionally well-versed in nearly all modern human sciences while holding specialties in at least a few fields. Of course, thanks to that you are also rather exceptional at reverse-engineering technology, which allows you to do such things like obtain working knowledge of the mechanics behind Covenant technology and even begin to understand the 'hows' behind some of the mundane pieces of Forerunner technology currently littering the galaxy. Perhaps you could eventually reclaim them.


-Gero's Genius (SB Dragonball Z) (800CP)
        Dr. Gero is easily one of the greatest geniuses in the entire Universe, at his peak he was capable of creating beings that far outstripped the Gods. You now share both the capabilities and knowledge he held in his prime. Entirely mechanical androids as strong as Eighter? You could design and make a dozen with less than an afternoon's worth of work. Recreating the technologies of the wider Galaxy such as healing pods and FTL spaceships? Maybe a day of work. You have all the knowledge to recreate all of Gero's stronger cybernetic and biological Androids too as long as you have the materials on hand. Androids as strong as 17 and 18 would maybe take a week's worth of work, as well as a human test subject. An android as strong as 16 would probably take an extra week, but one that could reach the heights of Cell would be the work of at least a year. Finally, you gain the incredible ability to recreate technology after simply studying it. You also gain the ability to improve on these technologies, and have a good sense on how to have them develop entirely new uses with just minimal work.


-The Maddest Science Yet! (Tenchi Muyo) (800CP)
This perk grants two features that in universe depend on your setting, out of universe both work unless you desire otherwise. 
Slice of Life: Your brilliance is such that you can build amazing inventions to solve all kinds of problems, easily accomplishing feats depicted in pulpy science fiction novels. More importantly however, you gain an absolute certainty in your work. Nothing made by your hands or under your complete direction can harm people (or planets) unintentionally. A comically large mess may ensue however.
Space­Opera: You can create supertech wonders, past mere conveniences into legitimately useful things like advanced starships, ray guns and miraculous devices. You can also enhance technology from other jumps with this skill. Note that trying to build an FTL starship from scratch on an undeveloped world will probably take ten years...






-Karma Chameleon (GUNNM) (900CP)
        Your biology isn't content to just sit around and wait for the next generation to surpass it. A constant internal struggle, a genetic hothouse under your skin - writhing tests of new muscle fibres, skin weaves, neuron insulation, circulatory system innovations your body is constantly tweaking and advancing itself to better fit with the demands placed upon it. This isn't just reactive evolution, though it is that - it's the brute-force computation of a billion tiny computers, a constant drive to exploit every advantage. While it's very slow, you may find yourself growing internal electroreceptors when your cells notice that most of the really dangerous things around you have EM signatures, or find your dietary preferences shifting to include metals and silicon to reinforce your bones and slowly hybridise into a truly biological robot. When you do actually struggle and fight and bleed, this process is sped up by an order of magnitude in the course of a single fight you might find your blood incorporating foaming clotting agents, or your eyes and visual cortex adapting to cyborg-speed combat. You can ultimately develop any biological ability you want, though whether you get it is based on your cleverness in providing the right evolutionary pressures - you might want a secondary heart and end up with none at all. Additionally, while results never really cease, they tend to plateau when you cannot actually challenge yourself meaningfully in life-or-death situations. Any other biological powers that you have benefit from this as well, constant tweaks and adaptations that may not be quite what you expect, but always fulfil a purpose.


-Karmatron Dynamics (GUNNM) (900CP)
        Macro Karmatron Theory Also known as psychohistory, this is the science of human destiny, a mathematical model of sociology. Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings.
        Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil.
        Nano Karmatron Theory Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness.
        It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs. These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble.
        At the moment, only karmic singularities individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh. Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and gradually shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will.
        With Karma Chameleon, you injected yourself with a prototype form of the Imaginos nanomachines. The result is initially little more than human, but far more capable of self-improvement and adaptation and it can be actively guided and designed by your own will. Effectively starts with Regenerator Nano, which will usually become slower and slower as your body becomes more powerfully augmented. With Berserker Body, you now have an Imaginos v1 body. Begins at (and will vastly surpass) 100x peak human.


-Engineering Savant | Foresight of Ouros (Starcraft II - Co-Op Missions) (1000CP)
        Foresight of Ouros (400CP)
        Ouros is a skilled prophecy-maker, warning the Overmind and Zeratul of the future and the trouble coming. He managed to do this while imprisoned, without his captors noticing. His prophecies were able to outmaneuver Amon.
        You aren't there in duration, scope, or clarity. But you can make instant prophecies for yourself. Your ability to predict an upcoming battle is nothing short of miraculous.
        You can predict the type and proportions of enemy units involved, the (general) tactics used by the enemy commanders, the nature (but not exact timing or location) of any surprises the enemy wants to throw at you, and a starting heatmap of the enemy forces. Never get surprised by a new variant of Hybrid again.
        Don't expect to make a second prediction during the battle, though, as your essence will need to recover for some time after doing this. This power can grow if you have a psychic uncapper or Xel'naga Essence, and grows fastest when sticking with tactical precognition.
        This also improves the power of any of the capstone 600 CP perks you buy from the origin lines.
        Engineering Savant (600CP)
        You were the one who designed the improvements to your units. You have great knowledge of your race's technology, especially your units. You have especially deep knowledge of the units and structures of your armies.
        Your knowledge extends past your own faction into the other factions within your race. You can integrate other techbases that you are familiar with into your units and structures. You have the curiosity to see worthwhile paths, the experience to see the troubles that will emerge from your projects, and the intellect to be able to come up with the solutions. The only thing left for you to provide is the determination to make it through the setbacks. Expect to be on the level of Abathur, Karax, or Swann.
        If you have the Foresight of Ouros, then you gain similar familiarity with the technology and engineering of the other two races, as well as gaining more detailed knowledge of an equal number of units and number of structures from the other armies. Expect to be on the level of Stetmann.


-Godling (Orion's Arm: Sephirotic Empires) (1000CP)
        Must have both Transapient's Mind and Superior perks: You are an SI 3 entity. Now, you are capable of using wormholes for travel, and many other technological feats previously thought impossible. At this level, you may as well be an eldritch god to modosophonts, as incomprehensible as your mind now is. Reverse engineering complex technologies takes but a few milliseconds, and all but the greatest and highest technologies are in your reach. You can effortlessly manipulate beings of lower intelligence than you, and nothing less than SI 3 or higher equivalent beings can match your intellect. To compensate for your immense size, you can now send mobile avatars to do your bidding. You are now a civilisation unto yourself, and if you weren't capable of this previously, you can now manage solar system sized polities down to the individual facility. Post-jump, your consciousness can once again be housed in smaller bodies.




 --- Domain: Skills: Alchemy (21) (63 Perks) --- 




-Alchemic Prodigy (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        One of the most profitable and respected professions in Tamriel, a good alchemist can find lucrative work just about anywhere on Nirn, from Necrom to Stros M'Kai. Aside from a good bit of experience in identifying herbs that can be used for medicinal (or malign) creations, you have enough experience to work with up to Rank Five solvents and oils (Purified Water and Pitch Vile respectively), with a whole decade to learn even more. Healing potions, potions to bolster physical attributes, or even debilitating poisons can not only be produced, but with adequate testing you can even begin to mix and match their effects by combining the right ingredients.


-Alchemy (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning) (100CP)
        Your brothers and sisters in battle often need a health potion after a hard fight, and you have always been there to help out. You are a capable alchemist able to work with almost any ingredient to make potions with the effects you need, and find substitutes for absent ingredients. Some more potent potions still stump you, though, and inventing new recipes is beyond you.


-Alchemy Knowledge (Golden Sun) (100CP)
        Alchemy was sealed long ago, but you've spent your entire life researching what little is left of its secrets, and the society of the ancients that used it. While mostly theory, this knowledge could serve you well should you seek out the ancient's settlements, or perhaps in greater ways in the years to come.


-Collection of Spirit Flames and An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients (Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension) (100CP)
        These two books are each roughly the size of a volume of an encyclopedia, though the level of detail is closer to that of a college textbook. Together, they are the ultimate reference on preparing delicacies with spiritually powerful effects. Collection of Spirit Flames describes various spirit flames of different attributes from the first-grade to the fifth-grade, each of which is used with different ingredients and at different times in the cooking process. An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients lists tens of thousands of spirit herbs, fruits and vegetables, grains, demon beasts, wild animals, and so forth, as well as their effects when consumed. Even non-spirit chefs can benefit from their clear explanations of how to control spirit flames and how some poisonous plants, mushrooms, etc. can be prepared safely for consumption. An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients updates in future jumps to list ingredients from that setting. While they remain the same size no matter how much information or how many pages are inside, you will always open the books to exactly the page you were looking for if you have something specific in mind.




-Tinkerer (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (100CP)
        Many believe that alchemy is just mixing up random things to make potions or hit a lump of iron until it becomes a steel sword. They don't know the truth. Alchemists like you need several skills to get their license: starting with blacksmithing to create weapons and armor, chemistry and herbalism to mix potions that work, anatomy of both monsters and people so they can loot properly and their creations don't end up causing harm to the users, different forms of art to cater the clients; mineralogy and even some basic knowledge of magic, for enchanting their works. You are decently trained in all these skills, which are the basis for any alchemist to thrive in society.


-Albedo (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (200CP)
        The counterfeit flame of life burning in the soul of every Alchemical is both gripped by Decay, and yet at the same time burns all the possibilities of Alchemy. This has granted you odd insights into how to break down and reform matter. You can make various alchemical substances, products that have impossible properties. Using sand as a base ingredient, you could smelt it into stone that once it hardens, is highly flammable. Or both pliable yet harder than steel. Such transformations are partly fueled by the flame of false life that burns within you - it is an alchemical flame almost without equal, and when utilized properly it can have incredible properties. You need proper tools to work and transform the materials you're working with. You're alchemically treating the materials, not enchanting them, so you can't simply 'lay' the effect on them. Whatever you end up doing should be something that can be framed as 'material properties' rather than 'enchantments.'


-Alchemist (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (200CP)
        The fine art of turning lead into gold in the quest to create the immortal granting elixir of life. What few remember is that alchemists rely on more than just magical ingredients for their mixtures. Chemicals, elements, oils, tinctures, spices, metals, it is not the magic that matters to you but the results of the combined reaction. Your abilities at brewing are beyond that of even the most skilled potioneers as anything that relies on ingredients to create you can make. Your favorite marinade, new alcoholic beverages, beauty products, intangibility potion, napalm, whatever you set your mind to you can make a reality. You know all the proper techniques and tricks to squeeze the most essence out of your ingredients, how to harvest them without botching it, how to store them so they don't lose any of their potency. You know the best ways to prepare them, the best time to add them, how to get the reaction you want and all the steps to achieve it. You can even tell which ingredients compliment each other best based on smell, taste, touch, and any record of their properties. If being a master potion maker isn't your goal well there's always opening a bar, getting your own cooking show, or running a chemical factory of some stripe because a philosopher's stone is something you could make by just cracking open a few chemistry and potion books.


-Alchemist (Overlord - The Series) (200CP)
        You are capable of brewing potions with magical effects. You can easily create 'true' healing potions that provide instantaneous healing rather than healing-over-time, and can make potions for any 'buffing' spells you know that are in the ranked magic system such as flight, invisibility, increased magic resistance, physical boosts, and so on. Obviously you must actually know a spell in order to make a potion with that spells effect. Additionally to make use of this talent you must actually have the means to make the potions in the first place such as an alchemist's lab or, for slimes, your own body.


-Alchemy (Final Fantasy IV) (200CP)
        A lack of magic makes you no less useful, and you've learned how to make use of the various potions and other items on a grand scale. You can mix together multiple items, compounding their effects. It doesn't create something new, but instead additively combines the source materials into something with as much potency, to the upper limit of five times the strongest of your source materials.


-Alchemy (Masters of Magic) (200CP)
        While all wizards are capable of converting gold to mana, and vice versa, the process is very inefficient for them, losing half of the value in the process. You can do it perfectly, without any loss, making it potentially feasible for you to power your magic through taxation, for example. In future jumps, this will provide a boost to alchemical abilities, especially those converting one substance into another. You only retain the ability to convert gold to mana (and vice versa) in future jumps if you purchase this ability, which would provide one way to obtain mana in the future.


-Alchemy (Samurai Jack) (200CP)
        The ancient science of mixing specific ingredients and then infusing them with natural energy. You know how to make a wide array of potions with both beneficial and harmful effects.


-Alchemy (Unmodded Minecraft) (200CP)
        You know Minecraft's alchemy recipes front to back, and understand enough of the theory to begin experimenting with the ingredients of this world and others to make new potions. You'll also occasionally get a little more out of your efforts than expected, sometimes getting a free second potion at the end of the distillation process, and rarely a third.


-Alchemy (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (200CP)
        The art of alchemy is much, much older than many know. These older alchemists were much less interested in transmuting lead to gold and instead developed a pharmacopeia of drugs, potions, and poisons. You are knowledgeable and skilled in the mundane forms of alchemy, but you are also capable of brewing more impressive supernatural concoctions. From simple tonics to improve one's attributes, to love potions, to philters that grant supernatural protection. You begin knowing only the weakest forms of these but you can improve your alchemical skill and even develop new recipes. Alchemical drugs can be prepared in the form of a classic potion, a salve that must be applied to the skin, or an essence that must be inhaled.


-Crafting: Alchemy (Aion SB) (200CP)
        You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. Your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting.


-Dao of Alchemy (Renegade Immortal) (200CP)
        Alchemy is the art and science of using spiritual materials and reagents to create miraculous pills and concoctions with an incredible range of effects. From pills that can heal grievous wounds or cure horrific diseases to poisons so terrifyingly potent that just a single breath can melt the flesh from your bones. Elixirs that induce states of enlightenment or restoratives that can drastically improve your cultivation, help you break through bottlenecks or just simply refill your reserves of spiritual energy when you are low.
        For the less talented, alchemical creations can represent their only hopes to break through to the higher stages of cultivation, be it the Foundation Establishing Pill, the miraculous medicines that can allow for the creation of nascent souls or even stranger things.
        You are an incredibly talented alchemist with an intuitive grasp of the process of pillmaking as well as the way ingredients may interact, allowing you to make leaps in the process of refinement, or even creation of new recipes, that would require years of hard study for others. This kind of talent allows you to easily analyse and recreate pills with a short period of examination.
        Talent isn't everything though. A senior with decades of experience will always do better than a pill genius on their first time. You have the equivalent of a good decade or two of practical experience with alchemy under your belt as well as a wealth of theoretical knowledge. If a reagent or pill has existed on Suzaku or in myth, then it's likely you know of it and the ways that it can be used or otherwise nurtured if it is not yet ready. This knowledge will update itself to include similar disciplines in future jumps.


-Natural Remedies (Twokinds) (200CP)
        Academic pursuits are all fine and good, but mages need to make a living like anyone else. To that effect, most of the magically inclined make money by selling alchemical solutions and other plant-based compounds. Your knowledge of alchemy and herbalism lets you craft everything from common medicines to potent poisons. While not as powerful as purpose-built magic, these natural alternatives are the preferred purchases for all but the wealthiest of patrons. Any village would welcome an alchemist like you.


-Neoalchemist (The Glass Scientists) (200CP)
        Invisibility serums, subtle poisons, superspeed formulae, if the Victorians ever imagined it could be done with chemistry, you can do it.


-Potioneer (Hercules) (200CP)
        There is a lot of magic in this world, and a lot of it takes the form of potions. Which is great for you, as you're now a truly superb potioneer and alchemist. You have a gift for mixing ingredients, enriching them with magic if you need to or just cutting and preparing them just right. You're also brilliant at coming up with improving recipes or coming up with new ones, having a gift for these things. Making a potion that turns a god into a mortal is well within your capacities provided the right ingredients, and that's only one potion.


-Slime (Overlord - The Series) (200CP)
        There are many types of slimes and oozes. All of them uniformly are next to impossible to hurt with physical attacks, but are incredibly vulnerable to one type of elemental damage (fire for a regular slime, ice/cold for a lava slime, etc) and also possess a slight weakness to magic in general. You possess the ability to take on a human form that will pass even close inspection, while losing none of the benefits that come with being made up of an amorphous slime-like substance, and possess physical abilities at least twenty times that of a human. Including speed, despite how odd that may seem. You can naturally fit through tight spaces, shape your body into unnatural forms, and can make as many 'feelers' or 'manipulator arms' as you like. In truth you're more like a uniformly colored Shoggoth than you are anything else, except without all the eyes and body parts. Slimes are also powerfully acidic and can inflict grievous acid damage on anything they touch; you naturally possess the ability to determine whether or not your acid will damage the things you are in contact with. All Slimes are naturally good at alchemy and can create alchemical substances and magical potions, if they possess the knowledge of their creation, directly out of their own body. Slimes, due to their nature, are ageless.


-Alchemist (Dishonored 2) (300CP)
        Did you study under Hypatia, the famed alchemist of Addermire? Or perhaps you were from Gristol, and were tutored for some time by Sokolov and Joplin, who famously created the cure for the rat plague more than a decade ago? It matters not. Medicine, botany and chemistry is where your talent lies, and while the 'wet sciences' are not as flashy as those of clockworks or galvanics, there is no end to the utility they can be put to.
        You are a masterful producer of tinctures and remedies, but also poisons and other chemicals that find use in combat, like gunpowder and the ingredients used in explosive projectiles and the Howlers' bombs. You'll be sure to get a lot of customers, whether for your beneficial concoctions, or your baneful ones. You might even surprise yourself with what your mixtures are capable of.


-Alchemist (Morroblivion) (300CP)
        You are a skilled alchemist, capable of making strong potions and poisons and knowing what ingredients are required.


-Alchemy (Castlevania) (300CP)
        Through careful experimentation and research, you've gained understanding of the true nature of God's creation of the world. You may now utilize a lesser form of this art to create items of power, ranging from potions and charms to powerful weapons to drive back the forces of evil. You also understand the basics of a darker form of this art, enabling you to understand and counter evil rituals.


-Alchemy (Gothic) (300CP)
        You can identify local plants and their properties and create magical potions. Healing and mana potions are the most common on the market, but with some unusual ingredients you might be able to create potions that permanently improve the drinker's body. You also know how to brew or distill various alcoholic beverages.


-Alchemy (World of Warcraft) (300CP)
        Mix potions, elixirs, flasks, oils and other alchemical substances into vials using herbs and other reagents. Your concoctions can rejuvenate, enhance attributes, or provide any number of other useful (or not-so-useful) effects. High level alchemists can also transmute essences and metals into other essences and metals. Alchemists can specialize as a Master of Potions, or a Master of Transmutation. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-Alchemy | Mixing Mixtures (Banjo-Kazooie) (300CP)
        Alchemy (100CP)
        You are incredibly capable at mixing together mundane ingredients to create effects that can only be described as magical. For a short time, these potions can create temporary copies of you, turn you invisible, or give you shielding.
        Mixing Mixtures (200CP)
        Your created potions can bestow multiple effects you know, however mixing too many might cause surprises. You can Reliably mix up to a dozen elixirs without them interfering with the effects of each other.


-Blessing of Medicine (Jobless In Another World) (300CP)
        You possess an absolute, innate, and intuitive knowledge of all plants and other organic compounds and what they can be used for in terms of making medicines, poultices, potions, remedies, and so forth. Additionally you automatically qualify as being able to make those things regardless of whether or not you possess the normal class requirements for doing so, and further possess the skills needed to actually make them no matter how complex. Even beyond that you can make things that would otherwise be normally impossible, such as elixirs of immortality (of the agelessness variety) or things like the Limit Breaker potion which would allow you to expand the level limit of a class by up to ten times its normal amount. In future worlds you will easily be able to adapt any recipes you've already discovered to use local ingredients.


-Creation Prodigy (Ar Tonelico) (300CP)
        Grathmeldingis an artificial magic created as a safer alternative to Song Science by the Goddess Eolia. By combining items via ritual alchemical methods with a Grathnode crystal, the immense Silver Horn wrapped around the tower detects the signal emitted and computes a burst of transmutation magic in response. This ranges from creating magic swords, mechanical armour, advanced prosthetics, healing potions, guided missiles, all the way up to airships and extremely powerful emergent creations beyond the knowledge of Eolia herself. You can divine a deeper logic behind the often-bizarre recipes and have much better odds when devising new Recipes. For those who live away from Ar Tonelico, Synthesis is the more scientific form of the same process. You're just as good at this.


-Deranged Alchemist (Van Helsing) (300CP)
        You have mastered the medieval forerunner of chemistry, and know the transformation of matter via elaborate rituals and mysticism on top of your scientific approach. The greatest secrets of Alchemy still elude you, such as the fabled Panacea, but that can be found in due time. (Hint: Nobody's found it. At all.) However, you are capable of transmutation of many materials (although it requires that said materials be the same base) and can create Homunculi from following Paracelsus' studies into alchemy.


-Ingredients' True Potential (Wonderland No More) (300CP)
        There are many magical foods throughout Wonderland, but many of them will not show their full potential unless used by a Gourmancer. You now have a natural knack for detecting potential ingredients (this includes living beings as well) you can use and getting a general idea of both their tastiness and what powers they might offer. If said ingredients have potential uses that wouldn't be normally available, you have greater luck at unlocking their full potential.


-Red In Leaf And Branch (Earth Girls) (300CP)
        The largest beasts can be felled by the smallest spearpoint if that spearpoint is covered in your poisons. You can make dozens of different poisons for all sorts of different targets and circumstances. Poison to make a pool full of fish float to the surface, for arrowheads to bring down big animals, or toxic smoke that disorientates invaders. Even some that just keeps bugs out of bedding.


-Shamanic Chemist (Clive Barker's Jericho) (300CP)
        As a little boy, your family made sure to pass down the ancient lessons of their family. Shamanism and Alchemy, two parts from each side now united into one student, yourself. You're an expert alchemist and an experienced shaman. Alchemy enables a wide range of potions and substance creation, from fluids that heal injuries and turn lead to gold or which assist with the creation of metals that can harm and bind spirits. A useful thing, given your Shamanism training is all about contacting, summoning, binding and then making use of all kinds of spirits, from the elementals of the earth to the ghosts of the beyond and even, if you want to walk a dangerous path, the demons of the Pyxis. Your training has incidentally given you a pretty in depth knowledge of chemistry, pharmacology and botany too.


-Alchemical Mastery IV (Essential Body Modification Supplement) (400CP)
        Learning speed increased by x1000, applies to the art of alchemy and potion creation. At this level, you can become an Expert (equivalent of a college degree and a few years of experience) in an hour and a world-class master in ten hours. See the Notes section of the Essential Body Mod Supplement for details on how learning speed is modified by different factors.


-Alchemical R&D (Buso Renkin) (400CP)
        You went down this path of your own free will, and since no one would willingly grant you such amazing powers without a price you had to learn everything yourself. Because of this you know everything there is to know about making homunculus, down to the best place to insert the embryos. That being said, you can't do any of this without a laboratory and whatever DNA you plan on incorporating.


-Alchemical Tome (My Little Pony - Friendship Is Magic) (400CP)
        A large book containing hundreds upon hundreds of recipes for magical poultices and potions and it even guides you on how to make your own potions. If purchased multiple times you will have books with rarer and more unique recipes until the fourth purchase which contains a book with merely five recipes, all of them truly legendary in potency.


-Alchemist (The Mighty Boosh) (400CP)
        The final, most powerful skill of the Shamans. The ability to brew potions and craft poultices that can create strange magical effects. While you can make some powerful stuff, up to the level of a pint of Shaman Juice, you still have to deal with the issue of logistics. You need to have the right ingredients on hand, and the right amount of time to brew it properly. Also this perk gives you amazing knowledge regarding how to properly create various kinds of alcohol from different base ingredients.


-Alchemization (SBURB) (400CP)
        Alchemization is strange business, creating punch cards, double punching and overlapping them to combine items into entirely new items. It's quite an amazing process, but sometimes unpredictable, and without care you could end up with exceptionally silly results. You however, are something else. The moment you get access to an Alchemitter, you will be the most fashionable and deadly kid in paradox space. All of the style will belong to you. In addition to instinctively knowing how to find the best combinations for outfits, weapons, and such things, you'll find it also easy to make useful tools such as a Captaroid Camera, to use things in alchemy without having to actually put it into a sylladex. Handy if you want to duplicate your brain, or something too large to fit. In general, if alchemizing something is possible, you'll be able to think of way to do it.


-Alchemy (Valkyrie Profile) (400CP)
        At its most basic, alchemy is simply the creation of magic concoctions and items with a range of effects, from the mundane, such as healing items and exploding liquids, to the horrifying and illegal, such as the much feared Ghoul Powder that turns the living into mindless demons. From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy.


-Berserum (Smash Up) (400CP)
        You know all about various improvements to nature, a veritable cornucopia of drugs to enhance combat ability. Drugs to remove the need for rest, to harden flesh to stone, for alertness and overpowering strength and maybe the development of psychic powers! It's all very exciting.


-Citrinitas (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (400CP)
        You can now create alchemical engines like your own Kindling flame, a physical transformation that establishes an immaterial alchemical flame inside something that then fuels further transformations. This can be used to create constructs or solid state systems that behave like mechanical systems. Yes, there are mechanical computers, and yes, such systems can be impossibly good - the alchemical equivalent of a clockwork soldier. This perk explicitly plays well with other creation and crafting abilities you have, including Albedo. The Alchemical Flames these engines are build out of are fueled by Silver, Gold, and the very fires of life. Corpus works too. It may be possible to work with other supernatural fuels, but unless it's something like the power cosmic or Quintessence, it will require significant work to adapt.


-Essence Distillation (Generic Universal Monsters) (400CP)
        Lesser minds scoff at the idea that science can effect the soul. You know better. You have learned to brew a concoction that will draw forth all the evil in a person. Allowing it to overwhelm other personality traits and indulge in their dark desire without restraint. You're most of the way to creating a similar situation for goodness as well and proper research will allow you to do the same with other character traits, brewing liquid courage or objectively in a bottle. While under the effect of one of these drugs, a person's appearance will change, often into a body which seems to radiate the enhanced quality.


-Feed Me! (Orion's Arm: The Amalgamation) (400CP)
        You can rapidly transmute any solid or liquid mass into the material and resources you want. By consuming mass, you may rapidly process it into something you can use to craft. Alternatively, you can just use it to build another clone.


-Milkshake! (Make A Wish) (400CP)
        You are a prodigy at making potions, capable of preparing any type of exotic ingredients and making potions that give nightmares to even experienced masters, you have knowledge of many potions made in this world and change them to taste like strawberry milkshake or any other flavour you like, you have a knack for learning new recipes, modifying old recipes to work with new ingredients and creating new potions wholesale with creatures out of this world. You also have the less regarded ability to mix cooking talent and knowledge of chemistry with your potion making, which makes your potion making linked with cooking knowledge and chemistry.


-Thaumaturgical Focus[Transmutation/Alchemy] (Fate Jumpchain) (400CP)
        There exist many special arts within magecraft, and now you have gained the knowledge of one of them. There are many schools of magic to specialize in, such as Alchemy, Memory Partition, Thought Acceleration, Transmutation, Jewelcraft, Curses etc. You could even learn the Emiya art of Time Manipulation, though you will have only the very basics, and will need years just to get to Kiritsugu's level, but you may possible go even further. You may not choose any True Magic with this perk. This perk can be bought multiple times


-Alchemical Expertise (eXceed) (600CP)
        Alchemy is the ancient art of drawing power from mystic artifacts. Unlike some variations of it you may have seen already, its core principle is imbuement and extraction.
        First, one must select an object with a useful quality, then they must understand this object fully through study. Then, through this understanding, one may refine this quality into a free-floating concept. This concept may then be applied to a useful vessel, which will benefit from such.
        For example, one may learn all that there is about a fighter jet, to the point of being capable of explaining everything about it and its operation and function with absolute certainty no matter what circumstances befall it. Then, one may reduce this particular jet to its Flight alone. One could then add its Flight to a suit of armor. An alchemist could then tap into the concept of Flight within it to soar.
        One could do the same to an industrial electromagnetic order to acquire the concept of Magnetic Attraction, or even a living being in order to acquire the concept of Self-Replication. However, one may only bind two concepts to any given object, and they may not be removed once set.


-Alchemist (Farscape) (600CP)
        Your knowledge of plants, animals, and chemicals allows you to mix up all sorts of different compounds. Finding cures to rare diseases, synthesizing fuel, and creating powerful hallucinogens, among other things, is a breeze for you.


-Alchemy (World of Darkness - Sorcerer) (600CP)
        Alchemy - This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as alchemists, and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.
        [1] The alchemist may create more advanced versions of mundane chemicals, such as painkillers and glue. They are not overtly supernatural, and can easily be passed off as just a better brand.
        [2] All that the first dot offered and more. The alchemist can create short lived steroids and potions that grant mystical senses for short periods.
        [3] The alchemist's enhancements can now create mildly superhuman physical abilities and grant low level psychic powers, at least for short periods. They can also create materials and alloys that surpass what should be possible.
        [4] More potent versions of what is available at 3 dots.
        [5] With great study - or a sample - of a supernatural creature, the alchemist may replicate their various mid-level abilities for short periods. More potent abilities come with side effects.
        [6] At this level, an alchemist may create such miracles as the Elixir of Eternal Youth, or even induce an Awakening.
        Alchemy Rituals
        One dot: A powder that, when mixed with alcohol, induced sleep almost instantly., or a pill that suppresses the symptoms of the common cold or flu for a full day and halves recovery time.
        Two dots: A form of LSD that grants vague but accurate visions of the future or a drug that doubles running speed for up to an hour, but leaves those with low stamina shaky and out of breath for the next.
        Three dots: A metal alloy that is lighter and stronger than titanium, but easier to work, can retain an edge almost forever, and stays more resilient than the finest blade,or a metallic dust that reveals hidden, disguised, or invisible things for what they are, disrupting illusions.
        Four dots: A chemical that raises physical abilities for up to eight hours, possibly even to superhuman levels. Side effects include an insatiable appetite during this period. Another option is a regiment of drugs that slows down the aging process to one twelve its natural speed.
        [5] A potion of this magnitude allows its drinker to match the physical abilities of a vampire for an hour.
        [5] A pungent substance that is especially disgusting to werewolves, to the point where none dare come within five feet of whatever it is smeared upon. Anyone else with a sense of smell will also be reluctant to do so, but not to the same extent.


-Alchemy Mondays (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (600CP)
        The ancient, and basically lost, study of alchemy. Not even in the ranks of the hidden mages of Earth you can find someone who knows much of it, well, outside you, of course. Your family was actually one of the last (if not the last) practitioners of this study field, leaving you with vast knowledge and resources to explore it. What's more, you possess an incredible raw talent for this field of study, making the secrets of this lost art an open book to you. With some effort and little time, you will be able to reproduce the great feats of alchemy, like transmuting lead into gold or create a Panacea that can cure all ailments. Not even the Philosopher's Stone is out of reach.


-Darkbrew Traditions (Dota 2) (600CP)
        Chymistry, otherwise known as alchemy, is your forte. Simple transmutation such as breaking silver down into copper or lead into tin are rather easy, you having discovered the secrets to brewing the required liquids for the reactions to occur with great safety and speed, and more basic brews such healing draughts which vastly accelerate cellular division and potent acids able to break down living matter and metal alike are also known to you.
        Generally speaking, transmutation turns like into like, while direct concoctions perform feats the common folk would liken to regular chemistry enhanced by magic. How true that may or may not be is generally ignored by Smallkeen, as the art is incredibly useful for scientific research and the cultural hatred of magic would foul many promising leads. Whether or not you are a member of the Darkbrew family is your choice, and any particular goals regarding mountains and transmutation of gold are your own to decide.


-Equivalent Exchange (Minecraft) (600CP)
        You are a powerful Alchemist, able to infuse a Diamond with the power of Redstone and Glowstone to make a Philosopher's Stone. With such a stone in hand, you'll be able to create a Transmutation Tablet, allowing you to instantly convert matter from one form to another, possibly even converting ordinary dirt to valuable Diamonds... or even compressing the Diamonds further into Dark Matter or Red Matter.
        Combining your transmutation skills with these exotic and vastly expensive forms of matter, you'll be able to produce Alchemical Chests with incredible volume, indestructible equipment with immense power, energy collector systems to generate additional resources from nothingness, and potentially become nearly immortal, burning vast quantities of resources instead of taking wounds.
        Your powers are all incredibly expensive to use, and you won't be able to max them out in your time here (especially if you don't have any advantages in harvesting resources!), but the raw potential of this path exceeds all others.


-Legendary Master- Cooking (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert culinarian. You could make a dish worthy of kings with nothing more than dried rice and stringy wolf meat. In addition to boosts in production speed and efficiency, you will always be recognized in any future Jumps as a chef of renown. All prepared by you gives a not-insignificant boost to mood, additionally positive effects of any cooking you do are much greater. That muffin baked with trace amounts of healing root? Before it could fix a scratch or two, now it regenerates limbs.


-Master Synthesist (Kingdom Hearts) (600CP)
        To make a sword you normally need metal, a tool to shape it, and a forge to heat the metal. Not you though, you can take strange and esoteric materials and magically combine them into a health potion, or a ring that increases your durability.
        Once you've gotten the hang of it you'll be able to turn the rare materials you've collected into powerful items, weapons that can turn the tide of many a battle. A few examples are making arrowguns that shoot homing laser arrows and can combine to fire a giant bouncing blast, a stringed instrument that can make water dance to your tune to form aqueous duplicates to attack with, or even a deck of cards than can temporarily trap the loser of a game of chance in card form.
        The greatest expressions of this craft, Save the King, Save the Queen, and the Ultima Weapon, will require years of experience, and some resources so rare you'll be lucky to find enough even if you scour all the worlds you can. The rarity and power of the materials used will impact the final quality and properties of the finished product.


-Reaching Omega: Alchemy (Desolate Era II) (600CP)
        Something has happened to the Dao you've been cultivating Jumper, your Dao has traces of becoming an Omega one. All it would take is following your instincts to allow you to transform it into an Omega Dao. be careful however because a Dao like this means an even harder time passing the Daomerge
        * A Omega dao is the highest class of dao, meaning this perk sets you on the path to becoming literally perfect with the settings version of runes.
        * Dao is essentially the laws of heavens that cultivators learn to control reality. Omega laws are essentially merging all your laws into the one law to make it supreme. It is also required for reaching the peak of cultivation. So for example a omega dao of formations would allow you to create universe and multiverses with formations.
        * This would easily allow you to make pills that contain universes, pills that could destroy the universe, pills that could grant limited reality warping, etc


-Terrorism (Ragnarok Online) (600CP)
        While the Alchemist can create bizarre brews that allow them to create all sorts of quirky lifeforms, it becomes quickly evident that having a massive pile of bottles with all sorts of different labels is not an effective way to proceed. The solution appears to be rather simple.
        Mixing everything together has some rather disastrous effects, but it does reduce the amount of bottles you need dramatically. The bottles are now creating some bizarre hybridization of the plants, which spit bombs that explode into acid, before eventually exploding. All that experimentation did help the Alchemist with one thing it's possible to mix anything together now within a magic conjured stasis field even if the field will only hold together for a short time if the mixture is...excited.
        This was labelled under the Terrorism classification and never spoken of again. Presumably, other mixtures could be added in to make the plants even more...bizarre.


-The God-Catching Alchemy Meister (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (600CP)
        When someone asks a kid what an alchemist is, they think of a great creator that takes leaves and lumps of iron, making them into elixirs and legendary weapons. Indeed, when someone asks a kid what an alchemist is, they think of you. Because your skill, insight and experience are enough to challenge the most esteemed alchemists in this land and come out victorious.
        Your creations ooze creativity, shown as they need far less materials than normal and your skill is enough to do them in less time and have far superior products compared to any other alchemist here. From accessories that make the user immune to some element, trinkets that allow for teleportation or the more direct weapons that can cause an instant death in the victims. Furthermore, your talent hasn't weaned at all, and you still see room for improvement in your works. You're one that could take the precious title of 'Meister', if not aim ever higher.


-Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation (Journey to the West) (600CP)
        Alchemy and matter manipulation with the understanding of the 8 trigrams to represent the fundamental forces of reality and how to represent and enforce change using these. Let me break this one down for you. It's like FMA alchemy but with less focus on direct creation and more turning one thing into another of a similar size, including living things. However it cannot create life where there once was none and it requires you to write out a short formula describing the change to make it happen. Feel free to turn sand into water, sheep into boulders and anything else you can think of.


-Alchemical Formulae (Generic Sugar Bowl) (800CP)
        Woah nelly! You could do a lot with this sort of power! Besides being able to make just about any kind of potion you can think of (nothing to make you completely invulnerable, though), you can even make a new living creature, with the right ingredients. You'll need three flowers for its skin, hair, and eye colors (or two coat colors and an eye color), some clay for body, some sugar for energy, some spice for depth of personality, and an ingredient for each personality trait you want them to have, up to eight main ones. Now, this ritual does take a month or two, and you have to hand-pick each ingredient. What's more, you need enough clay to actually sculpt a body of the size you want to make.


-Alchemist | Formula Formulator (Secrets of Evermore) (800CP)
        Alchemist (200CP)
        Considered a lost art, the science of Alchemy has reawakened in Evermore, and you've been trained in its use. By combining ordinary ingredients together using an alchemical formula, you can transform them into effects that can only be described as magic. You know both Light Alchemy, the art of healing or protection, and Dark Alchemy, the art of attacking. While it's theoretically possible to learn Alchemy at a later point in Evermore, this will let you skip the training and get straight to the mixing and casting, and will make you significantly better at it to boot.
        Formula formulator (600CP)
        Learning new alchemical formulas is pretty easy once you've got the basics down. You, on the other hand, can do something much more difficult, and much more impressive. With careful experimentation and tinkering, you can create your own formulas, allowing you to unleash entirely new alchemical effects nobody's ever seen before. Stronger or more useful effects will generally require rarer ingredients, and they usually need to relate to the effect in some metaphorical way, but as long as you keep those rules in mind you'll be coming up with new alchemy in no time.


-Heavenly Flame (Battle Through The Heavens) (800CP)
        Within Heaven and Earth, there are some abnormally strong flames formed by natural forces. Each their own force of nature, these domineering flames are the kings of all other flames. In their presence all other flames of similar or lesser power will submit. Each flame will have its own special ability, such as triggering eruptions or attacking the soul. These flames are widely sought after by receptariers as they can be used in 'borrowing the flames' to refine pills of much higher quality, as well as break down much stronger materials. There are 23 known types of Heavenly Flames, which have been ranked according to their strength. For 400 CP you receive a Flame of rank 13-23, 600 CP for rank 4-12 and 800 CP for rank 2-3. It is a little known fact that the rank 1 flame is actually a merger of every other Heavenly Flame. Of course, it has long been suspected that there are more Heavenly Flames out there, that have yet to be discovered or created. Even some of the known flames have unknown effects. As such you can choose to create an until-now unknown flame. Its strength will match the price you buy it at.
        * Can and should be taken multiple times, each of the flames have unique alchemical properties that can be looked up on the wiki.
        * Bear in mind that the lower tier flames cost less, not 800CP


-Synthesis: Rank 3 | Efficiency: Rank 1 (Atelier: Arland Trilogy) (1000CP)
        Synthesis (400CP)
        Synthesis is the most basic art of the alchemist and deals with the creation of items, usually through simple mixing, though sometimes synthesis can be a complex sequence of magical and chemical reactions. All alchemists learn this to some degree.
        Seeing as you're an alchemist, the synthesis of items should really be second nature to you. That being said, even if you're already an expert, there's nothing saying that you don't have room to improve further. Also there is no reason why we can't help you improve, if you're willing to put in the effort to learn.
        Rank 0: The basics of synthesis, learning how to make basic potions and food without proper ingredients is still pretty helpful. Sure, you won't be making anything high quality anytime soon, but at least you can make something safely edible from refuse material. It still won't be good for you, but it won't kill you.
        Rank 1: Don't like the looks of what you've made? No matter, just give it a makeover! You can substitute the appearance of what you've made with something else similar to it in nature. Of course, appearances are exactly that, so don't expect the function of your item to change.
        Rank 2: Enhancing what is already present, the items that you create will often possess some small trait related to its original function, generally acting as a sort of minor boost. The nature of the trait will never go against the intended purpose of the item a potion that normally heals health may also help recover a small bit of your magic.
        Rank 3: Practice makes perfect, and you're still a long ways away from perfect. Each time you make that same item, the quality of the product increases, resulting in increased magnitude of the intended effects. Though the gains will diminish the more you create a single item, you'll find that by the time you reach the plateau you'll have nearly twice the original effect.
        Efficiency (600CP)
        As you grow in your skills as a crafter, you'll start to see more and more requests being handed your way. Before long, you're going to realize that you don't have all the time in the world to make everything that is requested of you, and that's when it becomes all the more important to complete your assignments efficiently.
        Efficiency isn't just a matter of time management it's about managing waste, reducing redundancies, and above all improving yourself. Yes, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of wasteful choices you have to make but should you apply yourself to this, there's a lot more to efficiency than what you'll learn by scratching the surface. All it depends on is whether you're disciplined enough to follow through.
        Rank 0: As advertised, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of waste produced during your crafting process. Achieving a 1:1 conversion will not be possible with this alone, but being able to turn the waste product into a desired product can go a long way to making synthesis more manageable.
        Rank 1: if you can use less of an item, you won't need to make as much. The effect of any item that you craft is increased slightly from its original magnitude, and their durations are again increased slightly. It will take you a little longer than usual to create items but that's an acceptable sacrifice.


-Mist Alchemy | Core Artificer | Refined Ichor | Mist Collector | Harvester | Lens Mastery (Nexus 2.0) (1150CP)
        Mist Alchemy (100CP)
        Mist has more uses than simply being used to create Mistlight Manifestations, the most common form is Mist Alchemy, imbuing Mist into a material to subtly alter its properties. This is a minor boon, imbuing heat aligned Mist into metal might prevent it from forming stress fractures during quenching or remove the need for tempering, while imbuing an herb with life aligned Mist might make it better suited to making a healing poultice. Minor things that, combined together, can provide useful results.
        This is commonly used for making simple conveniences or simple tricks, such as pots or pans that more evenly distribute and hold heat or musical instruments that carry their tune farther than normal, rather than proper enhancements. Though medicine enhanced in this way is fairly potent.
        As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to synergize the traits of wisps of Mist used for Mist Alchemy to achieve greater effects and gives you an innate intuition for how a wisp of Mist will affect an object when imbued in various ways. This stacks with the Mist Affinity perk.
        Core Artificer (200CP)
        A surprisingly rare item to be found in Nexus is the Core, a metal, stone, or wood sphere imbued with Mist and possessing carved 'instructions' in the form of various patterns and runes. Cores are used as a way to give greater flexibility to someone's use of Light for Seed Sorcery. The Mist within the Core can be used as an external lens that rapidly shifts the Light within a Seed towards its own traits, changing a Seed to match its alignment within seconds (if already blank) or just over a minute (if already colored in another way). You know how to create such Cores. Do note, however, that this requires a good deal of Mist to accomplish, and it needs to be strong before it is imbued into a Core or it will provide minimal results. As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to power Cores with powers other than Seed Sorcery and you are capable of creating Cores that are not spheres, or are even another item entirely, such as a sword.
        Refined Ichor (400CP)
        This small jug is filled with the refined ichor of a hacker. Worth its weight in gold, this substance is useful for a number of purposes. Most commonly, it is used alongside Mist Alchemy in enhancing a material or object or to directly enhance the effects of Mist Alchemy. Further refinement turns it into essence, which can temporarily boost one's Light as if they'd cracked a blank seed or it can be mixed with other substances to give a minor increase in Light, this is an incredibly small boost, but is noticeable. It can also be used in manipulating Mist, making refinement more precise, improving cultivation results, and making smelting easier. Finally, it can be used to enhance the innate physical ability of the user, though how this is done is only known by the demons of the Border Ring. There may be other uses, but they are largely unknown.
        Mist Collector (50CP)
        When any creature with Light dies, they leave behind a small echo, a wisp of glittering Mist, colored similarly to the Lenses the individual possessed in life. These wisps are also touched by the memories and emotions of the being's life, altering its properties somewhat. The collection and manipulation of these wisps of Mist are the basis on which Mistlight Manifestations come into existence.
        Collecting a wisp of Mist is easy, simply touching it will stabilize it and allow it to be stored indefinitely. But utilizing a single wisp of Mist to create a Mistlight Manifestation will result in a lackluster Manifestation, weak enough that even humans, who lack the reserves of light necessary to become proper hunters, prefer to make at least a few modifications before doing so. To that end, there are three methods of strengthening a wisp.
        First is smelting or fusing. Taking two or more wisps of Mist and combining them into a single, new one with the traits of both. This is by far the easiest and fastest method of empowering a wisp of Mist. However, unless you know exactly what your wisps of Mist are and how they'll react, combining them in this way may lead to complications, such as opposing traits canceling out or mutating into a new trait that has a negative impact on the whole.
        Second is cultivation. By 'feeding' a wisp of Mist, it is allowed to grow organically and produce new qualities and traits over time. Allowing a wisp of Mist to grow in this way is fairly simple, and with its organic growth it's unlikely to have any complications, but this process is time consuming, potentially taking weeks or months to yield the results on par with smelting or refinement.
        Lastly is refinement. This is a rather difficult process that removes unwanted traits from a wisp of Mist, much like cutting and polishing a gem. This process has you excise traits and qualities from a wisp of Mist, allowing the other aspects to grow in strength as a result. This is a quick process and is unlikely to cause any real trouble, but you must be very precise and careful during the process or you may leave behind bits of what you wanted removed.
        Additionally, wisps of Mist are useful for another purpose. By binding a wisp to a Seed, it can act as an artificial Lens in the use of Seed Sorcery. Seeds formed with a wisp are, however, slower to grow than those that use your own Lenses. Cracking a Seed with a wisp will often cause the wisp to dissipate, though some Seed Sorcerer's have learned how to reclaim the wisp used for this prior to cracking the Seed.
        Harvester (100CP)
        You know a somewhat uncommon technique known as Harvesting, a process by which someone extracts a wisp of Mist from a still living being. This is not damaging, per se, but can put stress on the mind, body, and Light of the one having this done to them. Fighters will sometimes use this to get an edge if they can find an opening to pull it off. It is possible to pull wisps of Mist from yourself with this technique, but it requires a large amount of focus to accomplish without failing. You are able to reclaim wisps used in Seed Sorcery. As this technique can be learned in jump, paying for it makes it more effective, reducing the necessary focus and allowing you to use more advanced forms of harvesting, such as causing greater levels of fatigue with each wisp pulled from an individual or to temporarily empower your Light by consuming the resulting wisp of Mist.
        Lens Mastery (100CP)
        Lenses tint Light towards their own alignment, and using them together is a matter of experimentation to get the desired results. Sapphire goblins find this far more intuitive, able to carefully manage their Seeds with ease, as if each seed had their full attention, easily sliding lenses between Seeds to create a desired result.


-Simple | Advanced | Alkahestry | Truth (Fullmetal Alchemist) (1300CP)
        Simple (100CP)
        You understand the connections between parts. You can make large alchemy circles far more easily and far less complex than others. You can combine this with Advanced Formulae for multipurpose combat alchemy.
        Advanced (100CP)
        Alchemy comes to you as easily as breathing does. Your greater understanding allows you to perform more complex alchemy. you can combine this with Simplified Formulae for multipurpose combat alchemy.
        Alkahestry (300CP)
        You understand how to perform basic Alkahestry, an art from Xing which can perform transmutation from a distance using linked circles, and can heal wounds of many kinds by following the pulse of the body. With practice or tutoring you can make a real skill from it.
        Truth (800CP)
        Choose to lose either of the four. Your voice, your dominant hand, Your non-dominant arm, or your dominant arm. In return you gain the ability to perform alchemy without a transmutation circle and your knowledge of the science is expanded to the point where you have effectively mastered both simple and advanced Formulae.


-Plasmids Are The Paint | Veni Vidi Vigor | Gatherer's Garden | Adam Slugs (Bioshock 2 + Bioshock Infinite) (1500CP)
        Plasmids Are The Paint (300CP)
        ADAM flowed through every vein in Rapture to some degree. Plasmids were a force that could sway the entire economy with each new formula released. Suchong and Tenenbaum were certainly the two spearheading development, but they were not the only ones. There was an entire field of geneticists tinkering in their labs on how best to mix the human genome like a cocktail. You were one of these minds. You have a decade of practical experience playing and modifying genetics, but are particularly skilled when it comes to creating Plasmids and Tonics. While you are by no means a world-changing genius like the two greats previously mentioned, you are more than capable of creating your own ADAM-based products given a lab and supply of the substance. What you do with this knowledge is entirely up to you.
        Veni Vidi Vigor (600CP)
        You know how to create Vigors having access to the formula and having witnessed the process. You know how to create 3 Vigors currently in existence and you are in a unique position to design and create your own through experimentation. Your experiments with ADAM are guaranteed to lack negative side-effects.
        Gatherer's Garden (400CP)
        My daddy's SMARTER than Einstein, STRONGER than Hercules and lights a fire with a SNAP of his fingers. Are you as good as my daddy, Mister? This rather cheerful little vending machine will advertise the Plasmids and Tonics inside with the voice of a little girl and a merry melody or two. Unlike other vending machines, this one doesn't use money, but requires vials of ADAM instead. This one comes stocked with virtually every Plasmid and Tonic Rapture has to offer and never seems to need restocking, but caveat emptor. These ones come with the usual range of side effects that plagued the citizens of the city. So make sure you limit how often people use it or have a steady supply of ADAM on hand. Unless you want to create wild Splicers.
        Adam Slugs (200CP)
        Ugly as they are, these deep sea slugs glow with the bright red of ADAM in their veins. They naturally produce the raw material, which can be harvested from them and easily refined into the necessary building blocks for Plasmids and Tonics. However, harvesting the slugs directly yields very little ADAM and would require dozens to generate a single new Plasmid. But it is what it is. It's not like you would implant them in little girls and then harvest their blood for larger amounts of ADAM. That would be monstrous. The slugs come in a small aquarium that won't need maintenance to keep them alive and will refill to contain six slugs every week. Just keep the lid on. They like to wander.


-Potion Grandmaster | Magus Cultivation | Wizard Cultivation | High Grade Meditation Technique (Warlock of The Magus World) (1500CP)
        Potion Grandmaster (600CP)
        Potioneering is the art of using ingredients both from the natural world and from the body of powerful beasts to create powerful concoctions with an incredible range of effects. From increasing spiritual force, to creating powerful attacks that can be combined to create stronger attacks, to poisons that can kill Magus of a higher rank before they can even notice, to elixirs that can help increase vitality or help to purify a Warlock's bloodline. With time and ingredients, a potioneer grandmaster can create potions for every situation and event. From Acolytes to Rank 9 Magus all Magi of each rank require potions.
        You are as the name suggests now, a Grandmaster of the art with a masterful aptitude to potion making as well as the knowledge of how a wide variety of ingredients interact. Allowing you to make leaps in the process of potion making as well as creating new or re-making old ones that would for other potioneers take decades of mind-breaking work. Of course, you wouldn't be a grandmaster with just knowledge, would you. So this comes with a 100 years of actual experience in the art, as well as a host of knowledge of all recipes found in this world barring those lost to the world. But hell maybe you can find them one day.
        For another 300 CP you also gain the knowledge and skills of an Alchemical Grandmaster, which are experts in the creation of all kinds of magical items. From defensive items that protect from attacks of other mages, to one shot attacks that contain far greater power than the actual creator. But remember, the quality of an item is not just dependent on the creator but the materials as well.
        Magus Cultivation (0CP)
        In this world there are 12 ranks that a being can achieve, 3 Acolyte ranks and 9 Magus ranks. To improve and advance through the ranks of Acolytes, an Acolyte must improve their spiritual force to reach a certain number, and have to construct mind runes with each level increasing the number of mind runes being needed. To advance to a rank 1 Magus, an Acolyte requires their spiritual force to reach a certain number, a rank 1 spell model and either Grine water or a high-grade meditation technique.
        From Magus rank 1 to 2 a Magus's spiritual force must reach 80 and their elemental conversion must reach over 80%, with 99% being the maximum being reached. To advance further from rank 2-6, can simply be done by improving spiritual and soul force. From 6-8 is done by comprehending different laws and smelting those laws into their own and finding your own path. Then comprehending the laws of space and time into your own path to reach rank 9. What many do not know is that there is a 10th rank that can only be reached by creating a greater law.
        Wizard Cultivation (500CP)
        In the World of Gods, there exist many different classes and many ways to reach stronger tiers of power. There are also ranks and tiers, to become stronger a being must reach rank 20 to become Legendary and from there can advance from a Demigod to a Greater God and eventually can become an Overgod.
        The most powerful class here are Wizards, magic casters who utilize the Weave, a creation of one of the Greater Gods. The way Wizards work is by paying spiritual force to the Goddess Of The Weave to buy the authority to use magic, this manifests as spell slots. Each Wizard gains an additional spell slot as they advance in rank, with them gaining access to deeper levels of the Weave as they reach certain milestones. However as soon as they use the spells they lose the memory of the spell models. Drop-In starts out at Wizard Rank 1, Acolyte's Wizard Rank 4, Old Monster Rank 6 and Mortals start out with nothing.
        Before you get too excited, Wizards come with drawbacks you see. As you are using spiritual energy to pay for spell models to insert into the spell slots. It doesn't matter how much spiritual force you possess, as the same amount is needed to pay for all the different ranks of spells. If you use all the spells and have none left you will be powerless unless you use scrolls. Also as soon as you have cast the spells, the spell models you see within the Weave are forgotten.
        For 300 CP, whether as a result of luck or bloodline you are not a Wizard but an Arcanist, an attempt by Ancient Magi to merge the power of a Wizard and a Magi. Arcanists are the founding fathers of Wizardry, able to supersede the Weave's restrictions. By perceiving the energies in the environment and utilizing the elemental particles in the air, they can draw it to form arcane spells. So long as an Arcanist has enough arcane energy and the correct spell models, any spell under the legendary realm can be cast (that limitation is only if the Arcanist themselves are not in the legendary realm). They also possess the passive ability to amplify arcane energy by 10-20% when they cast spells. Arcanists can also remember any and all spell models within the Weave.
        Now, if you think that isn't worth 300 CP there is something you should know Arcanists aren't simply battle spellcasters an Arcanist can do anything a Magi can; alchemy, enchanting, force-fields Arcanists are Magi with the ability to utilize the Weave and are not suppressed by the World Of The Gods. In order for an Arcanist to advance requires their spiritual/soul force to grow as well as comprehension and sensing of arcane energy.
        Now, you are probably thinking that isn't good enough especially the Wizard option and you would be right so for just an extra 200 CP you are not tied to Myastra's weave anyone but to your very own. Just like Shar has her Shadow Weave you now have the Jumper Weave (name totally your decision). This weave possesses all the spells and features Myastra's does but is totally under your control giving you access to every inch of it. Unlike Myastra's, your Weave is linked to every jump you go to from now or from the past to the future allowing you access to it whenever and wherever. Oh and don't worry about it getting destroyed no one will ever notice it.
        High Grade Meditation Technique (400CP)
        When it comes to advancing into an official Magus there are two ways this can happen either through Grine water or a high grade meditation technique. The difference between the two being that through the former you could turn a spell 1 model of your choice into your own innate one however with this method when you wished to advance later on if the spell model you chose was incompatible with your earlier ones it could result in the Magus's death as well as the fact the Grine water damages the Magus's spiritual force preventing further advancement, the latter using techniques is far greater as the technique itself provides the Magus with innate complementary spell models. With this perk, you can purchase your own meditation techniques whether canon or one you thought of yourself and yes this includes Warlock techniques. You can purchase as many as you wish for 200/400 CP each.
        For 200 CP: The technique will be limited to the Breaking Dawn Realm or Rank 6 Magus/Warlock and with just this technique you will no longer be able to advance further as Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher needs to comprehend Laws to advance.
        For 400 CP: Normally meditation techniques would be useless at Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher but this one is special as it compliments your elemental affinities allowing you to gain comprehension on the laws based on your elemental affinities thus allowing you to reach and become a Rank 9 Magus/Warlock. There is no limit to the rank you will be able to reach with this one day reach rank 9 of course, just because you have the way doesn't mean you WILL reach it after all talent is everything and for rank 9 you still require comprehension of space and time this method only gives you a path to that rank that will never cripple you.
        Post-Jump meditation techniques works in cultivation jumps as its equivalent to the highest quality version of cultivation techniques, for 200 CP version it would only allow you to reach half of the cultivation path meaning if there are 12 ranks you can only reach peak of Rank 6, for 400 CP version would allow you to reach Rank 12 or the highest level of Cultivation.
        If there are two or more cultivations paths like cultivating the body and ki, the meditation techniques would become a two in one that cultivates both body and ki, if there are more cultivating path like body, mind, soul and ki, the meditation techniques would become a four in one that cultivates all paths.
        If you already have Magus Cultivation, Wizard Cultivation and High Grade Meditation Technique then subtract 900 from the cost of this
        You need higher and higher cultivation to craft those items, pills and potions so these extra perks are needed.




 --- Domain: Skills: Clothing (22) (41 Perks) --- 


-Battle-Ready Bathrobes (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        The title of "clothier" is misleading. Rather than being a simple seamstress, it's more accurate to say that a clothier specializes in making subtle but protective light armor that can easily transition from the ballroom to the battlefield and durable yet flexible medium-weight armors that are adored by scouts and survivalists during long treks. You now have that set of skills, able to craft any armor up to Rank Five (Ebonthread and Fellhide) and refine it with tannins. In time, you may be able to expand your skills further, perhaps even learning to sing-weave ancestor silk from the Moth Priests themselves.


-Costumer (Terraria - Journey's End) (100CP)
        Many objects, especially with regards to armor, place function over form. Now, you don't have to settle for armor that is good but an eyesore. You can take any item you possess and 'overlay' it on top of a similar item, changing the second item's appearance to match the first, while maintaining all of its functionality, protective qualities, etc.


-Needlework (Earth Girls) (100CP)
        It wouldn't really be called tailoring, but that's basically what you do. Making thread and basic cloth from scratch, fashioning fur and leather into clothes, and fixing up all the rips and tears the others get running around. The clothing you make is always rugged and neatly made, too.


-Needlework (Marvel Comics Kid Superheroes) (100CP)
        Being on your own, you've had to learn to make and maintain your costume and gear yourself. You're pretty good at making and repairing clothes, armor and small electronics.


-Talented: Tailoring (Inukami) (100CP)
        You are an expert at any non-combat related skill. Cooking? You can make a five star meal with low rate ingredients.


-The Sewing Machine (The Incredibles) (100CP)
        Now you might be wondering why I'm offering a single sewing machine... That's because this technological masterpiece is the very platonic ideal of a sewing machine. This is the one machine fit to work on designs worn by GODS. Working with this will enhance all your sewing skills to greater heights.


-Arachne Silk (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (200CP)
        An endless strand of silk from an Arachne that can be used in making clothes. Clothes made with the silk are extra durable, so that even a wild beast couldn't leave even a tear on them. Stains on the cloth are easy to remove, but magical energies applied to the clothes have a trace of them absorbed and stored inside the clothes, giving off the scent of the energy.


-Coordinated Outfits (Kingdom of Loathing) (200CP)
        It seems that having a theme to your clothing has increased its power. Either that or everyone's crazy about your sharp outfit.


-Crafting: Tailoring (Aion SB) (200CP)
        You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. Your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting.


-Fur is always in (Earth Girls) (200CP)
        Even though the ice age is over, the winters can still be fiercely cold. The clothes you make are warm or cool as needed, and protect the wearer against the most extreme weather the world can throw at them.


-No capes (The Incredibles) (200CP)
        They snag on things, get caught in turbines, generally get in the way, and not many people can even pull the caped look off... Too much trouble to be worth it. And likewise, you can pick up on the weaknesses in designs extremely quickly, able to remove them or simply attempt to cover all your bases when you create something. Never again shall you create a suit that will fall short or hinder the wearer.


-Putting on the Reich (Indiana Jones) (200CP)
        They may fear your tenacity. They may hate your cause. They may even oppose your beliefs. But one thing remains constant: A begrudging respect for the aura of organization and sharpness you give off. You have an excellent sense of how to design uniforms that not only are intimidating and show the power of your group, but are also fashionable and make your group look organized, official in a way. It's time to show them who's Boss.


-Resolute Thread (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (200CP)
        You have a spool of thread that's supposedly made from the stomach lining of an Emperor Dragon over 2000 years ago. The more pressure applied to it, the stronger it becomes. You could bind a superhuman or use it to hang hundreds of tons off of the ground. Spool refills and used thread once a month.


-Secular Skills (Red Dwarf) (200CP)
        Through growing up in a society in which religion tried to stem the natural instincts of the cat people towards vanity and good looks, you learned to craft amazing clothes and outfits from the most basic materials and tools, and don't worry they all will look fantastic.


-Spinning Wheel of Arachne (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2) (200CP)
        Taking the form of an old spinning wheel with webs and spiders nesting inside the circle, this relic is a testament to the skill of those who would dare challenge the gods themselves. The spiders within eternally produce silk that is as glamorous as it is tough, letting one weave with a thread that never allows itself to be torn or ripped by normal, mundane means such as fist or blade. In addition, any fabric you attempt to feed the spiders will soon have its traits mixed with the silk, making the spiders create something marvelous.


-Tailor Made (Skulduggery Pleasant) (200CP)
        You have the knowledge of how to weave magic into clothes, making them incredibly durable and protective. They're capable of protecting the wearer from most things, including bullets, knives, magic, extreme heat, and large amounts of blunt-force trauma. They also look damn stylish.


-The Arachnid's Needle (Exalted - The Solars) (200CP)
        The Solar Exaltation was born in the crucible of revolution, intended as a primordial weapon of mass destruction. Yet the peerless artifice of the Great Maker coupled with the perfection of Ignis Divine led to something far more potent. Once the drums of war finally ended their beat, and the fallen titans locked away, many of the chosen found new ways to express their power during peacetime. These new god-kings saw the arts flourish at their hand, the perfection of their essence allowing the creation of unparalleled masterpieces. One such remnant of these lost arts is this needle, created from the spinneret of a titanic primordial behemoth and alloyed with orichalcum. Such a tool was used in the first age to weave some of the finest garments of its time, producing such wonders as a dress woven of crystal and glass, or a suit created from molten rock; thanks to its potent magic, almost any material can be worked with. Its exploits have been known for a millennia, and such constant use has left it with an imprint of its former owner's genius. As such, even the lowliest of craftsmen can create exquisite garments should they wield this needle.
        * The imprint of former owner should know how to make stuff with essence which seems useful


-Blessed By A God:Tailoring (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (300CP)
        Gain a blessing from one of the recorded gods, gaining a boost in whatever skill or stat they stand for.

Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on an even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-Stitch by Stitch (Earth Girls) (300CP)
        The clothes you make are gorgeous and suited to the person you make them for. They protect both the heart and the body of the person that wears them, sheltering them from physical sickness and 'spiritual' illnesses alike while making the most of their body.


-Super Sea Snails (Splatoon) (300CP)
        You have a small breeding population of around 10 Super Sea Snails, large snails with crystalline, conical shells. The snails are hermaphroditic and they live for around 15 years. They're more than they seem, they provide an invaluable service- Their shells can be used to imbue hats, shirts, and pairs of shoes with extra Ability Slots, or reroll the abilities of a clothing item with 3 full slots. This kills the Sea Snail, but if you're careful to keep up the population then eventually you might have an entire wardrobe of 3-slot clothing. Also, they're delicious when cooked right.


-Tailoring (Kill la Kill) (300CP)
        You have the knowledge of how to safely work with life fibers, and how to make them into clothing that empowers (or inhibits) the wearer. In addition, because you know how Life Fiber uniforms work, you know their weak spots better than anyone.

-Ambient Magic: Thread (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        Ambient magic takes different forms depending on the mage and the craft he or she performs. Each Ambient Magic is considered linked to a specific one of the four elements. There are a multitude of different forms of ambient magic, each linked to ages old traditions such as (but not limited to) cooking, dancing, smithing, weaving, animal tending, sailing, building, gardening, farming, and scribing; or to powerful natural forces, such as fire, wind, weather, and so on.
        Thread: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the manipulation and enhancement of thread, cloth, and other tools of the weaver or sewer's trade. It is practiced by Sandry and Dedicate Lark. Stitch Witches can enchant bandages to heal wounds, broider veils to hide identities, make clothes that protect like armor or ward away fire, and sew good luck or love charms.


-Battlesuit Tailor (Honkai Impact Third) (400CP)
        This lets you make custom battlesuits that help people develop better and focus their skills in
        specialized ways that their powers don't quite match necessarily but are 'close enough'. With enough practice you can make ones that aren't powered by Honkai energy and can be used by anyone.


-I used to design for GODS (The Incredibles) (400CP)
        And your skill is a testament to that lofty ideal. Designing things to be bold, dramatic, heroic, and just plain look good is as easy as breathing to you. Now the equal of Edna Mode herself, you'll most likely be asked to design for "super"models in Milan on a regular basis... but it's just not the same, Dahling. Your real skill lies with the Super fashion after all, and Super Suits is what you excel in. To the point that you could even make people look good in spandex.


-Incredibly Talented (In Another World With My Smartphone) (400CP)
        There is one area in which you truly shine. Pick a single skill or talent such as hand to hand, swordsmanship, magical innovation, alchemy, or similar focus. You are now, hands down, one of the best people in the world in that subject. An alchemist could come up with all sorts of new alchemical concoctions and potions that would astound and amaze your peers, a swordsman could cut down a hundred men on his own nearly effortlessly, a magical innovator could create new spells or rituals or magical items with unsurpassed vision and creativity, and similar such potency applies to any other skill or focus you take with this perk. Beyond that however you will always be able to refine your focus, allowing you to push yourself to greater and greater heights no matter how skilled you become. You may purchase this perk more than one, but it must apply to a new skill or focus each time it is taken.
        * Its a uncapper which is pretty unique and nice


-Life Fibers (Kill la Kill) (400CP)
        A medium-sized spool of Life Fiber. It's only enough to maybe make a pair of gloves out of, but with the proper knowledge, one could create Goku Uniforms- Or enhance existing articles of clothing to be like Goku Uniforms. One spool of thread is enough to make several one-star outfits, three two-star outfits, or a single three-star outfit, assuming you have the knowledge of how to work with Life Fibers.


-Log In Room (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (400CP)
        A room connected to your warehouse or a property that you own that seems very similar to the login room you see on entrance to Grounds' Nir, where you would normally equip your Percentage type Gear and customise your colours. This room accomplishes the same thing, providing limitless storage for all your clothing and allowing you to instantly fit on any clothing you own. It can also freely change the colours of any clothing you own as well.
        While it cannot create clothing from nothing, it does have two powerful effects. The first, it can turn existing clothes into Percentage Type Gear, giving it percentage based stat boosts that increase depending on how powerful the gear is, usually relating to the gears original purpose.
        The second, it allows you to combine existing pieces of clothing into a single piece of gear, combining their effects and appearance. Be warned that Percentage Gear requires you to have enough Willpower to handle it and making something into too strong a Gear piece may result in you being unable to equip it and gain the effects. Clothing made via this room or modified is made from Willpower, allowing you to instantly shed or reequip whatever you are currently wearing even outside of the room.


-Magic Steps (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        You possess a refined beauty, a keen sense of fashion, and an almost ethereal grace. You know almost instinctively how to pick clothing that accentuates features and attributes you want accentuated and hides those you want hidden, and to pick clothing that will be at the height of fashionability and functionality at the same time. Your movements are fluid, graceful, and, when combined with any form of dance, practically spellbinding. Your features are fine, reinforced by good bone structure, with lustrous hair (or scales or feathers) and skin and teeth that practically radiate good health and breeding.


-Sewing and Showcasing Room (The Incredibles) (400CP)
        A large room perfect for any sewing or otherwise creating of Super Suits and other clothing. It comes with high tech sewing equipment, an enormous supply of different mannequins, and a gallery for when you want to show off your best designs. Movable seating and extremely durable glass panes included. May be attached to the Warehouse or any of your properties after the jump.


-Sewing Room (Twokinds) (400CP)
        Just as a cook needs a kitchen and a mage needs a laboratory, a seamstress needs a sewing room! This cozy space contains every tool you'll need to craft beautiful garments and functional clothing. This workshop also comes with a wide variety of fabrics, fasteners, and other supplies you'll need to complete your crafts. Even rare and exotic materials, like drake leather and wyvernsilk, are included in your stockpile.


-Smart Clothing (Eclipse Phase) (400CP)
        Comprised of programmable fibres, Smart Clothing can alter its shape, cut, style and colour to mimic nearly any outfit, from Tron-like bodysuits with animated glowing panels, to a formal tux complete with tails, flower on the lapel and a handkerchief in the pocket, to going partially or totally transparent in case you wanted to show off your nanotats while working in outer space it's just a matter of programming in a new style. However, the smart clothing remains all one piece no matter how many parts it looks like it has, and making it look like armour or a radiation suit doesn't afford any more protection than its (moderately tough) fibres already do.
        Smart Clothing can be combined with an outfit you already own for free, such as your free Light Vacsuit, upgrading it to a Smart Fabric Vac Suit. As you have chosen to upgrade, your suit has all the extra features. The clothing is very heavily armored against both kinetic and energy attacks (easily shrugging off small calibre rounds or a laser pistol), and has a whole host of defensive modifications that make different attack modes (like laser, flame and acid) far less effective. The colour-shifting pattern can give you active camouflage and thermal signature dampening at a moment's notice, and you can even electrically shock anyone in contact with you.
        * Smart fabric Vac Suit is essentially a high tech space suit


-Superhuman Skill: Tailoring Cosmic Level (Generic Super Academy) (400CP)
        You possess greater than human levels of skill in a single occupation. You could be a superhuman sniper, martial artist, mechanic, chef, or any other area of skill. You may purchase additional occupations for an extra 100 cp each. At Street Tier you are slightly above what a normal human could achieve. This level in skill is equivalent to Bullseye's accuracy or Lady Shiva's fighting skill. At National Tier you can achieve feats of skill that would normally only be possible with machine-like perfection. You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform delicate brain surgery with a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that inspires a national revolution within days. At Global Tier the laws of physics become flexible when you practice your skills. You can bend bullets Wanted style, balance on a cloud, or swim up a rainstorm. At Cosmic Tier things get a little ridiculous. Your skills acquire conceptual level effects. You could shoot someone by targeting their shadow, dodge bad luck, or repair spatial rifts with duct tape and bailing wire.


-The Flock's Fleece (Actraiser) (400CP)
        Men and women have not wandered the wilds naked since the long-gone days of the Garden. Whether they knew it or not, the act of clothing oneself is one that at once protects and isolates. A shirt or a robe is a metaphorical armor against the elements, against shame and against the prying eyes of others. You are such a skilled craftsman that you can take the 'metaphorical' part out of the equation. You're a one-person clothing creator and tailor, able to take the raw materials of silk, cotton, wool and hide...and then with almost no tools produce wondrous clothing, fitted just right for anyone who dares try the garments on. They're protective vestments against the harsh elements, able to keep people in comfortable condition be they in the deserts of Kasandora or the icy plains of Northwall. Not only that, but people who wear them find that they'll be kept safer from the claws of beasts or the swords of their enemies, acting as a light chain-mail mesh despite being soft and maneuverable fabric.


-Requiem of Souls | Weaver | Silk Spinning (Jade Cocoon) (500CP)
        Requiem of Souls (200CP)
        You have been taught the sacred song of the Cocoon Masters, which allows you to soothe a Minion's raging heart. By playing this song to a weakened monster, you can capture it inside of an empty cocoon. The more damaged the creature is, and the more skillful your playing, the more likely you are to capture it. You can play the song again to release them, but by itself the Requiem will not make them loyal to you. This gives you basic proficiency in a musical instrument of your choice.
        Weaver (100CP)
        You are now an expert weaver. Doesn't sound like much, right? Remember that the silk spun from magical creatures' cocoons was so beautiful that King Karis murdered his own son over it. They have some REALLY good silk here in Parel is what I'm saying and you are a master of working with it.
        Silk Spinning (200CP)
        With a prayer to Elhrim, you can purify a Firefly Cocoon (a cocoon filled with a monster using the Requiem of Souls perk above) and spin it into silk. This kills the monster but produces truly breathtaking silk. The stronger the monster, the better quality of silk is produced. The strongest Minions could produce silk fit for a god. Who knows what you could make from the monsters you might find out there on distant worlds?


-And Machine Washable, dahling (The Incredibles) (600CP)
        Of course looking good isn't all there is to a good Suit. It also needs to be very sturdy, comfortable, withstand extreme temperatures, be bulletproof, specialized to complement the wearer's powers, and yet breathe like egyptian cotton. Oh, and be machine washable, that's a new feature. So, it's a good thing that you're able to create specialized Super Suits like these for virtually any kind of powers. Suits that stretch with elastic Supers, that go invisible with an invisible Super, and much more. With time you could even find ways to incorporate armor and electronics into your skin-tight suits. It may not be able to do everything... but it can do a hell of a lot more than it should be able to. And of course you also get the ability to create general technology to help out with your work, like high-tech sewing machines, laser turrets built into ceilings, and bulky invisibility generators...


-Industry Support (My Hero Academia) (600CP)
        Every hero currently running around out there has a costume of some kind like a full body badge, and equipment that complements their style or Quirk incredibly. Where did you think all that came from?
        When it comes to a career in support, it doesn't matter if no one has heard of you before, you're easily a top dog in the industry. Costumes and equipment alike are your forte and nobody can deny.
        Your costumes are form fitting, flattering, stylish and sturdy, easily standing up to the day in day out beating and stress that those who wear them put them through while keeping them looking amazing. More importantly, you're a flat out genius when it comes to this world's technology, making the various gadgets, machines and equipment that can take an okay Quirk to the next level. Elemental powers lacking in range or accuracy? You could design tools for that. Super strength, speed or some other physical ability putting stress on your body? You have the solution. If there's something someone needs to shore up a power's strengths or weaknesses, you can probably think up and build something over the weekend. You'll just need the tools, resources and a healthy dose of imagination.


-The Creator: Tailoring (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (600CP)
        Pick one area of creation. This could be blacksmithing, cooking, enchanting, or more. You now are the undisputed master of that craft. A blacksmith would be able to make unique and legendary class weapons by the dozen while cooks could make the tastiest food in all the realms, using previously thought inedible ingredients, so good that they may even have special effects like recovering stamina or health, or boosting your stats equivalent to ten levels for several minutes at a time. With time and effort you will only increase in ability, your growth uncapped in that area.


-Unusual Attire (Wonderland No More) (600CP)
        Wonderland certainly has some unique styles of clothes, with some humans preferring clothing made from paper actual paper, not recycled or mixed with something else! Yet they somehow make it work. You can now make clothes out of any material or substance you want, even if they would normally not work at all for clothing. These clothes will not harm the wearer even if their properties normally would. Even so, the materials retain their other properties, which may prove detrimental in their own way. For example, a glass ball gown would not be at risk of cutting the wearer (and wouldn't actually be that stiff when worn), but it would still be at risk for shattering if directly struck (and the shattered pieces, no longer counting as clothing, could hurt the subject). Or if you had shoes made out of molten lava, the user wouldn't be burned, but they'd set on fire anything else they touched (and that resulting fire could in turn burn the wearer). On the flipside, though, any positive attributes of the materials will also be retained.


-Yet Another Halloween Fic (Generic Buffy Fanfiction) (600CP)
        You can now create magical Halloween costumes which enables the wearer to take on the personality and powers of the costume. The total power of all active costumes cannot exceed the power of the one who made them, and they mute any powers the users would otherwise have. You can choose whether or not this overwrites the memories of the user or merely impacts their mannerisms.
        CAPSTONE BOOSTED: The costumes may now manifest into their own living forms. The clown make up and purple suit will actually form into The Joker or that pair of cat ears becomes a cat. The form will be true to your vision of the costume. The limit to this is the same as before, all active costumes together cannot exceed your total power. The living costumes and worn costumes are in separate pools though, so you can have one person equal to your power by wearing a costume, as well as one living costume equal to your total power. Regarding living costumes powers, this works per attribute; you may be a million times stronger than a base human, but if you've only got 10x the mental processing power of a base human, you cannot make more than 10 costumes with human level intelligence, or 5 costumes with double human intelligence.




 --- Domain: Skills: Enchanting (23) (40 Perks) --- 




-Geomancy (World of Darkness - Mortal) (100CP)
        The art of geomancy (known as feng shui in the East) is the study of harmonizing the physical environment with the flow of energy. The goal of feng-shui is to create the ideal place to live or work. Through a combination of architectural design and mystic mathematics, a geomancer plans a pattern that must be duplicated within the entire structure (in the case of a building) or the layout of a room or series of connected rooms (in the case of interior design). Implementing this design increases the time required and the cost of the work involved, but practitioners consider it well worth the effort. When designing a geomancy effect, the thaumaturge chooses a single Attribute or Skill to be the focus.
        Once assigned, the Trait cannot be changed without completely redesigning the location. Attribute-based designs are more difficult to create than Skill-based ones. The selected Trait must reflect the building or space's function. For example, a library might enhance academic or research skills. If the thaumaturge is successful, she creates a unique design that benefits those who use the location in the manner for which it was created, provided that the design is followed perfectly. If the thaumaturge creates her geomancy design successfully, and the architect or interior designer successfully integrates the design into the physical location, the flow of energy is modified within the space. Any action that takes place in the space using the designated Attribute or Skill may gain a bonus.
        Once a geomantic design is created and implemented, it remains in effect indefinitely unless something happens to disrupt or change the flow of energy. Natural disasters may change the magical landscape more than they appear to affect it physically, requiring geomantic designs to be realigned. New construction or destruction of buildings or even spaces within a building may require that a thaumaturge reassess the location for potential updates. Poorly designed geomantic locations may disrupt those around them, as well. The only limits on the number of designs a geomancer may create are her time, her capability and the ability of others to come up with the resources to put her designs into place.


-Inner Linings (Final Fantasy XIV) (100CP)
        A customer came to you one day with a strange request for you to make a leather jacket which would be thinner, enough so that it would take multiple jackets to equal the bulk and weight of a normal jacket. As strange as that request was, when you watched him enchant the various jackets it suddenly made sense. Instead of trying to enchant a single jacket multiple times, he would wear multiple jackets enchanted once. But you can improve on that idea. Instead of attempting to craft multiple thinner jackets, you've opened up inner linings in existing pieces of work. As you predicted, while the ease of stacking enchantments has gone up, the overall durability of the item has dropped by a bit. Perhaps with time and better materials, you could rectify the second point. Having so many inner linings also helps quite a bit when it comes to deeper pockets, which is a nice side effect.


-Prodigy Enchanter (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (100CP)
        Alchemists are the most known for giving magical properties to weapons and potions, and yet, any skilled enough mage can do the same thing, perhaps even better when it's an element they control well enough. That's the case with you, prepared in case you needed to enchant something and didn't have the time or resources to get a good alchemist. While the design and other details may not be as good as the work of a professional, you are capable of imbuing the power of magic in any item you wish to use. Effectiveness depending on your mana and affinity.


-You Runed Everything (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        Before the development of the Arcane Enchanter in the 4th Era which streamlined enchanting to the point that any novice without even the barest hint of magicka could bind an enchantment, and even before the Guild-standardized enchanting techniques of the 3rd Era which drastically eased the process to a simple matter of shoving stored magicka into an item, the tool of choice for infusing an item with a magical effect was the humble Glyph. A Glyph is a combination of three runes, one inscribed with the potency which determines the base strength and whether it adds or removes, one with the desired attribute to effect such as health or a specific element , and a third designating its aspect, ranging from Common to Legendary. You know enough to be able to use and translate up to Rank Five runes (Pora, Denara, Hade and Idode), with even more becoming available to you as you research and translate more.


-Augment Blade System (Dark Cloud 2) (200CP)
        A warrior needs a trusty weapon, and with blacksmiths in short supply, it seems that most people have taken to modifying and improving their own equipment. The main technique the survivors in this world seem to use allows weapons to grow as individuals might learning from experience gained in live combat. For as long as you continue to wield a weapon and use it, it will grow in terms of all its basic qualities, including traits like durability, strength, and ease of use. Should you switch weapons or pass your weapon on to another, the growth will stop until you pick that weapon back up again to focus on it. However, it will retain any experience it has already accumulated, so there's no worry of your work being lost over time.


-Heretical Adaptation (Senki Zesshou Symphogear) (200CP)
        Symphogears are, in essence, a Relic adapted into a combat system for it's ability to generate massive amounts of energy that can be formatted into a certain kind of matter through a generic mass-energy converter. However, they also have the ability to 'evolve' overtime, gaining additional armor and improvements to features such as onboard thrusters. With a bit of study, it might be possible to apply this adaptive behavior to other materials, encouraging them to improve themselves over time.


-Loremaster (Divinity - Original Sin) (200CP)
        Dusty tomes and yellowing scrolls are remnants of history, fragments of knowledge from ages past sent forward through ink and paper. While much of the world fails to give these storehouses of information their proper credit, those who dive into them discover lost secrets to hold true power. Or at the very least, a few answers. Loremasters nearly always have some form of magical talent, as it is the study of the arcane in essence. However, there are those for whom it is the extent of their abilities to draw out a few secrets from the books and little else.
        Apprentices of the old lore are taught, not by rote, but by arguments. They are told to seek out the flaws in others' logic, to pick apart the minutia of another's words, and to seek the shades of truth in every conversation. While at first no student sees the value in this, they soon learn that they can apply such introspection to the magical items they find. With a few moments study and a jeweler's loupe they can discern the enchantment bound to a particular item.
        Unlike the other skills, this one requires further training to see its true worth. In the beginning, a novice Loremaster will only be able to discover the basics of an enchantment. The essential element or driving force. But as one grows more experienced they will be able to pick up the minutia, dipping into the ins and outs of even the most subtle enhancements.


-Magic Style: Enchantment (Fairy Tail) (200CP)
        It's time to choose the Magical Styles that you have already learned upon entering this world. Whilst most magical styles can be learned with time and effort and the right teacher or source of knowledge, buying them here will allow them to benefit from the skill that Magic Skill ranks grant as well as allow access to extremely rare or lost magics or magics that require certain traits to use. A list of the magics that can be bought as well as their costs can be found at the end of the jump document. It should be noted that some Magic Styles will not be purchasable through this option. Most of these are Holder Type magics, which all deal with magical items that are offered for purchase in the item section, and some are simply Caster Type magics that are too unique and either offered as part of a separate perk or not at all. This may change in the future as the series progresses or not.


-Magic: Enchanting (Samurai Jack) (200CP)
        You can grant magical properties to weapons by marking them with ancient runes. Right now you only know how to give weapons elemental properties, but you can learn more enchantments by studying other enchanted and magical weapons.


-Magical Specializations (Kane Chronicles) (200CP)
        The true worth of every magician is their path specialization. You have come to possess knowledge, you have a few years of training in a path specialization of your choice, enough to make you an expert though you are still many years from being a master. A list of canon specializations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times.
        Charm Magic: The magic concerned with the enchantment of permanent magical devices and objects, such as a magician's tools and the ritual implements required for complex and powerful spells( many such implements are single use and highly specific) as well as pre-prepared spellcasting.


-Minor Enchantment (Gunnerkrigg Court) (200CP)
        Make boots that will always fit or makeups that change to your whims. These magical tricks have a very wide range of applications but will generally not be on a very grand scale; though the utility from walking on walls is not to be denied.


-Specialist's Hammer (Dark Souls 2) (200CP)
        Bridging the mystical and with the mundane, mystical with the tools of man, are there many acts more satisfying than that? With a solid hammer and good ember, you are capable of just such feats. You may harness the qualities of magical, supernatural or just outright strange materials to improve existing constructs not composed of such things. An iron sword could be imbued with the arcane nature of the soul to better bypass armor, or a shield with the power to halt darkness infused attacks. You are also bestowed skill with smithing, though mostly towards the area that the above powers require. That is to say, hammering and burning the powers of material described above into things.


-Weapon Absorption (Dark Cloud) (200CP)
        Were the Moon People the ones who developed weapons as they exist in the world today? Perhaps, with their technological expertise, they tampered with such things - but we may well never know. Your weapons modified with this will adapt the concept of "experience", allowing them to grow as more enemies are defeated with them. As more enemies are defeated, you can absorb other weapons into the base template - improving the qualities of the original weapon.


-Blessed By A God: Enchanting (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (300CP)
        Gain a blessing from one of the recorded gods, gaining a boost in whatever skill or stat they stand for. Additionally, you exemplify that skill or trait, standing heads and shoulders above all others in that field. These gods and goddesses cover just about every domain and aspect there is, from fire to beauty to magic.


-Profession: Enchanting (World of Warcraft) (300CP)
        Imbue all manner of equitable items with magical properties and enhancements using dusts, essences and shards gained by disenchanting (breaking down) magical items that are no longer useful. Enchanters can also make a few low-level wands, as well as oils that can be applied to weapons providing a temporary magical buff. You also have the ability to create Inscriptions which act as enchantments for your skills & abilities. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-The Great Enchanter (Bartimaeus Sequence) (300CP)
        Staff of Gladstone, Amulet of Samarkand, Ring of Solomonthis world sure has a lot of artifacts, heh? Well, now you can make even more! You become unbelievably talented at binding Djinn into items to give them mystical powers. Summon a djinni and stitch it into a rug to make a flying carpet? Easypeasy. Detonation Sticks, Convulsion spheres and flux bombs, all a day's work. You still need the parts, but they seem almost eager to flow into the right shape under your expert hands.


-A Price for Everything (Rick And Morty) (400CP)
        Curses! You can curse objects. The curse affects anyone in possession of the object and can only be dispelled by unnaturally advanced science or magic. The more ironic the object/curse combination the more powerful it is. Pairs of running shoes that cause people to run till they die, fox boas that skin the user, etc.


-Artisan (Silmarillion) (400CP)
        You are considered a skilled craftsman even among the Dwarves. Weapons and armor that can stand the test of time and come out looking newly crafted centuries later. Mithril and other mystical metals are no harder than working with Iron and Steel for you. With much time and energy you may also enchant the items as you craft them, like the Dragon-helm which struck an unnatural fear into the enemies of its wearer. While you are skilled in the crafting of many things it is your mastery of the construction of weapons and armor that is truly awe inspiring. Perhaps with practice and time you might even be considered the equal of Telchar.


-Craftsman (Hercules) (400CP)
        Greek myth sure does love it's weapons and armors, doesn't it? You're great at making both, now. Not only do you have a preternatural skill at putting together weapons, armor and other artefacts of the very highest quality, being able to work legendary items from common tools and materials, but you're also a whiz at enchanting them. Simply put, you can imbue just about any and all magic and power you have into items, and have it work as you desire. It also helps you figure out existing examples of craft, and replicating the effects on your own.


-Enchanter (Morroblivion) (400CP)
        You are capable of enchanting objects well. You know how to trap souls and how best to get good effects.


-Enchanting (Scooby Gamers) (400CP)
        You're an expert at enchanting things, knowing a bunch of basic enchantments and having the skills to figure out most enchantments on various items from just examining them.


-Enchantment (Silmarillion) (400CP)
        The Elves are capable of great works of Enchantment, able to infuse their spirits into things they create and tie into the natural forces of Arda. Rings of power, magical orbs that can see far distance, runes of power crafted alongside the Dwarves. You are an expert on the path of enchantment. Non-weapon enchanted items are your expertise and with enough time and training you could potentially create a ring of power to rival even that of Sauron or craft something in the like of the mighty Silmarils.


-Enchantment? (Dragon Age) (400CP)
        That's odd, you seem to understand the process of inscribing lyrium runes on items, to add or enhance properties. Without lyrium, enchantments are temporary.


-Iterative Improvement (Worm) (400CP)
        Each day you gain a certain amount of charge, which you can spend to effectively enchant objects with superpowers. The more charge you invest in a particular object, the more you can improve and expand its abilities. A single day's charge would give an object a minor power, but over time you can increase it with no upper limit beyond your investment. These objects only work for you unless you make it otherwise. As you use your power, experiment with it, and it matures from conflict and experience, the amount of charge you gain per day will increase. You can hold about a month's worth of charge at any one time, any more will be wasted.
        * Do note that at the end of the jump the power turns innate and is not supplied by a shard anymore


-Runeforging (Azeroth) (400CP)
        Runeforging is the art of imbuing your weapons with runes that grant said weapon additional abilities or strengthening your own abilities. Though the game only lists 4 abilities with this you can fanwank responsibly to add additional runeforge abilities of your own. Purchasing this perk also allows you to imbue a weapon with both an Enchant as well as a Runeforging.


-Elven Enchantment (Lord of the Rings) (500CP)
        You can enchant objects, if you pour energy into them as they are created. Some of your enchantments are useful in battle, such as swords that never dull and bows that always strike true, but most are simply to ease the life of the wearer, such as cloaks that weigh nothing and aid in hiding and water-flasks that never leak. You may also perform great workings, such as the creation of hidden doorways, given time.


-Enchanting | The Rune Is Mightier Than The Sword (World Seed) (500CP)
        Enchanting (400CP)
        Enchanting is a skill probably best described as the enhancement of an object's Aura. At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like a magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them.
        Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you're skilled in both of them, enough that you'll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself.
        With some experimentation, you'll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, after which you enchant the finished sword one last time after its completion.
        Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments like man made ones in them. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement of their aura, allowing for the creation of a staff that can match up to any plasma weapon, or a bow that will never miss its mark.
        You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continue to research and experiment, you'll also be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn't. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even something on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you. And considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might've thought, starting at a level others would need years to reach.
        You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment's notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you're doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you'll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you're attempting. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill.
        The Rune Is Mightier Than The Sword (100CP)
        The one thing throwing people off the runic language is its sheer volume. Considering that there are ninety-nine million, two hundred and thirty thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine of them, representing every single word and concept in all known languages, even things such as watering the grass every week, that's no surprise. Because of that, even learning the runic language can be a challenge, requiring either a brain implant or some other form of perfect memory. Anyone who doesn't have access to these things needs to spend time and effort to search for those runes they'll actually use and transcribe them into a book or save them to their computer. Luckily, you won't have to deal with such shortcuts: as of now, you are fluent in the entirety of the runic language, and will never forget it. Furthermore, as you will undoubtedly encounter words and concepts foreign to the people in this universe throughout your travels, it will update itself to include runes for anything you might encounter in the future.


-Enchantment (World of Darkness - Sorcerer) (500CP)
        The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. Five ranks, top rank cost 500CP. Examples of each rank below.
        [1] The Enchanter creates a minor item with limited use only and a tight area of influence. Such as a jacket that works as abnormally good camouflage in a crowd, or glasses that never fog.
        [2] The Enchanter creates a more powerful talisman that is noticeable as magic. A flask that blocks three bullets and no more, objects that increase a mundane skill by a noticeable amount when used.
        [3] The Enchanter creates a talisman whose function is obviously magical. Shoes that double running speed, a charm that can protect its wearer from magic three times a day.
        [4] The Enchanter creates a talisman that is able to defy several of the limitations of the Consensus. Clothing that grant superhumanly impressive but otherwise mundane abilities, a throwing knife that never shall never miss.
        [5] The Enchanter creates talisman with almost miraculous powers. A golem, or a ring that hides its user from magical detection.


-Call Me Parry (Eureka-Warehouse 13-Alphas) (600CP)
        You have a unique insight into how to combine Artefacts in order to enhance and alter the nature of their effects, often by an entire order of magnitude, and even create new Artefacts through careful research and experimentation.


-Crystal Crafter (Anima Beyond Fantasy) (600CP)
        The world is not one made for your kind. Artifacts are forged for wizards and warriors, and few for you. That will not stop you, however. By taking a gemstone, you can imbue it with potential, cutting and polishing and changing it until it amplifies the psychic abilities of the one who bears it, making the powers of the mind easier to call upon and stronger when used.


-Fuinjutsu Prodigy (Naruto) (600CP)
        You are one of the very few who are talented in the art of Fuinjutsu, an esoteric discipline combining all the complexities of calligraphy and physics. Despite the difficulty in learning fuinjutsu, skilled practitioners find it well worth it. Fuinjutsu, or sealing, is at its most basic storing something within something else through symbols to be released at another time. More advanced techniques still follow this same principle, but to great effect. Seal masters can seal away the elements, chakra, form summoning contracts, teleport, or even summon and bind souls using these principles. It's only downside is that this art is massively difficult to learn even for the talented, and will take years of intense study to master. You start off knowing how to make the two most basic of seals: The storage seal which allows you to store items in slips of paper much smaller than they are, and the explosive seal which is basically a few glyphs on a piece of paper the size of a greeting card that explodes like a small amount of plastique.


-Hell Jumper Creator (Dragon Ball) (600CP)
        Why let just one thing take pride of place as your favourite creation? If you make two, you can make them into an even better single creation! It just needs a bit of work here and there. With your personal creations, you're able to combine any two similar creations into a greater whole. While this combination can only be done once, it will be more and more effective the more similar the two parts that are being combined are. Two swords that you've made, without being the same type of sword or same material of make, would only be half again as good once combined. Two swords that are exactly the same, down to the method of creation and time spent on the smithing? You'd have a sword hundreds of times more powerful than either of the originals. So long as you personally made it or had a large hand in its creation, you'll be able to apply this fusion and even reverse the fusion to separate the two halves once more.


-Infusionist (Monster Hunter) (600CP)
        The ability to infuse items with abilities, Usually Elemental abilities. How good the infused ability depends on the quality and use of the item.


-Lord Jumper's Armor (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (600CP)
        You can infuse copies of your abilities into objects, turning them into focuses for those powers. Using these focuses in concert with the original power within your body will see your might with these abilities enhanced dramatically. Alternatively, you could loan these items to allies and subordinates to grant them access to these powers. Objects that you infuse with your power are also infused with your will. This allows them to act independently to enact your will, and enables them to refuse others the right to use the power they grant. You may only create one focus per power, and a given item can only contain one power at a time. When these items are destroyed, the power flows back into you, and you can create a new focus for it.
        Boosted: Your power has risen to new heights in a number of different ways. Firstly, you are capable of creating multiple focuses for the same ability with no loss in their overall power level, and using the same item as a focus for more than a single ability. The true strength of this ability, however, is that each and every one of your powers has become semi-sentient being of its own, a kind of pseudo-consciousness based on your will attached to the ability. These consciousnesses are aligned with you in terms of morality and intent, and can add their force of will to yours. When you work in concert with them, your precision, control, and raw power output increase without any additional exertion on your part. Furthermore, in the event that you are incapacitated in some fashion, these consciousnesses can take control of your body, wielding the power they are attached to in order to protect your body until you return. Alternatively, you could grant your powers control of your body while you fully devote your mind to other tasks. Because of this boost, you may choose to make your focuses tangible avatars of your individual powers, turning them from semi-sentient objects to fully sapient ones. These conscious powers will not manifest as whispering voices in the back of your head unless you want them to.


-Master enchanter (Unmodded Minecraft) (600CP)
        Removing the randomness and ambiguity of the usual process is the least of what you can do. You don't suffer any restrictions when it comes to what kind of item can get what kind of enchantment, so you can fish up treasures with a chain-sickle or empower a shovel to deal massive damage to the undead. Selectively remove or add new effects to an existing magical item, or transfer effects from one item to another. Fuse multiple similar magical items together to make a single, stronger item. While there are limits to how much magic that can be crammed into something, the limit is much higher for you. This skill also covers the creation of space-bending chests that can store far more than their external dimensions should allow for.


-New Age Necromancer (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (600CP)
        Once upon a time wizards were happy enough being able to raise undead, throw fireballs, and curse their enemies, well those were the old days and this is now. You are a modern wizard, you know the value of a well enchanted suit of armor. You know how to mix enchantments in such a way that things such as moving remote piloted armor suits are a very real possibility that you can make reality, magic powered railroads and three dimensional rune set ups are simply child's play for you, and even something as complicated as creating a gold powered dungeon heart is eventually possible. Though most enchantments are powered by mana you can offset this somewhat in two ways, either by instead binding the souls of the dead to your creations lowering the mana cost considerably the more souls you bind to it or by burning gold to take the place of mana that would be spent if you are squeamish.


-NineRealms Craftsman (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (600CP)
        You have the skill to create wonders; not only those of technology, but of magic as well. You're a skilled enchanter, capable of creating armor and weaponry that withstands the ages and never dulls or breaks; your skill is such that you can permanently enchant Uru safely, which would allow you to create weapons like Mjolnir or Stormbreaker. You're even capable of enchanting machinery; granting them similar magical effects, and more. Even without magic, your crafts are of quality worthy of the gods, and the quality of all of your future creations will be increased greatly. Post-Spark, your ability to create wonders will increase; weaponry that would allow one to go toe to toe with cosmic beings and bridges that span the worlds you've visited; with time, there's very little you couldn't create.


-The Fire in the Forging (Circle of Magic) (600CP)
        You have acquired a mastery of enchantment, the imprinting of permanent or semipermanent magical effects into your chosen medium. Weapons imbued with fire, cloth as protective as armor, far more powerful potions, cupcakes that satisfy all food cravings for days, trees that eat sound, stone paths that rearrange themselves every day... if you can figure out an effect, there's a good chance you can, eventually, figure out how to impart it... assuming you have the right magics and enough power at your disposal.


-Voodoo Crap Magic (Rick And Morty) (600CP)
        Are you the devil? Well even if you're not you have the ability to enchant objects. These enchantments are undeniably potent, the more fitting the object/enchantment combination the more powerful it is. Aftershave that causes intense attraction in females, a microscope that shows fundamental truths and so on.


-Lordship of All Things | Cultivation | Required Secondary Abilities (Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms) (800CP)
        Lordship of All Things (800CP)
        Formations can, through being shaped in particular directions, powered by multiple people or formation flags, result in a variety of different effects. Such effects include creating an attacking formation which would allow a small number of weaker cultivators to take out one stronger than them, or a trapping formation that only brute strength completely eclipsing that of the people controlling it could hope to break, and finally, one can even use formations to help gather elemental energy and ki so they can train much faster than what would normally be possible. All of this knowledge and more is now passed on to you, as you find yourself a master of Formations, their creation, and their utilization, as well as heavy insight into the Grand Dao of Formations. With a year of practice and the proper reagents, you could even conceivably create formations of the scope which caused the four thousand kilometer wide elemental stone mine in the Ji Clan's territory through the gathering of elemental energy, and with a decade, setting down formations like ones that would normally be set around the Ji Clan territory, capable of killing Celestial Immortals, could be qualified as a warm up (depending on your own level of power of course) Creating a formation such as the Rahu Formation that allows a multitude of cultivators to band together in order to form an avatar that is vastly stronger than the sum of its parts would take you a decade or so of research (once again, that is if you had the required level of power for it). Keep in mind, however, that creating formations also requires insight into the Daos. Creating a Wind Formation will be absolutely impossible without the necessary insight into the Dao of Wind.
        To add to this, you also gain tremendous insight into the Grand Dao of Constructs, allowing you to, with enough practice, create golems equal to the Daofather Golems that the Lord of All Things created, and make them in bulk just as he did. You do need the right materials and many assistants for that, however. Finally, you gain the ability to create and cultivate strange creatures known as Queens who are able to give birth to hundreds of warriors to create an army. Both the appearance of the Queens and warriors are completely up to you, and they'll be at the same level of intelligence as a normal sentient being. At first, you'll simply be able to make one or two of them at the Xiantian Level, with their children only being at the Houtian Realm, and only in their dozens. But as your own personal power increases, you could create or upgrade queens capable of rivaling even Empyrean Gods and cultivators stronger stall, with them being capable of birthing thousands of lesser creatures. The intelligence of their spawn is also variable, with some of the weaker grunts simply being like insects that the Queens can see through and puppet from a distance, and their generals being at the very top of the level they were spawned at and being just as intelligent as the Queens. This scales with your cultivation level as the Golems or Queens are always one level below you. In future Jumps you'll find yourself picking up arts and abilities similar to constructs and formations incredibly quickly.
        Cultivation (0CP)
        In this world, people use the art of cultivation to increase their powers. This practice is mostly divided into two ranks: Ki refiners, who generally rely on magical techniques and treasures to fight, powered by the Elemental Essences they absorb, and Fiendgod Body Refiners, who strive to turn their bodies into those of the ancient Fiendgods and utilize divine abilities with vastly varying effects, such as increasing their size, adding extra arms, or even strengthening their bodies beyond their already impressive levels, making their physical abilities and general battle prowess much higher than those of a Ki refiner in exchange for lacking the ability to use treasures and weapons. Thus you get a technique from each of these two types of cultivation to study. Be warned though, that although Fiendgod Body Refiners are much more powerful, their ways of cultivation may be painful to the extreme, or extremely hard to advance in, resulting in decades of effort for just a bit of progress.
        There are many stages to cultivation, starting with the Houtian Stage, which signals the very start of a journey, as well as the increase of a cultivator's lifespan to over a hundred years. Then comes the Xiantian Stage, where the body is completely reforged for perfection, and the cultivator's lifespan increases to over two hundred years. The third stage is called Zifu, in which the practitioner forms their own Violet Palace which contains their liquified Ki energy, and enables them to live over four hundred years. The fourth stage, called Wanxiang, is the stage of manifestation, where the practitioner gains access to Divine Will, and increases their lifespan to eight hundred years. The fifth stage, called Primal, gives the practitioner the ability to live forever* (not actually forever)*, with no limits on their lifespan After that comes the Void or Earth mmortal Stage. When a practitioner reaches the Void Stage and attempts to progress to the next level. they shall be met with a final Tribulation. This is a test sent down by the heavens in the form of heavenly wind, fire, and lightning strikes that they must either bear or face total soul annihilation. Then they must pass a test of their Dao Heart in the form of the Demonheart Tribulation, where they shall be tested to see if they are truly dedicated in the matters of Cultivation, and whether they are willing to abandon everything for its sake, though it can be resisted with a powerful Heartforce. If they succeed in this Tribulation, they shall reach the Celestial Immortal Stage, or, in the case of Body Refiners, the Empyrean God Stage, where they shall break free of the mortal coil and the five elements. After that, there are two more stages for both paths of Cultivation: True Immortal for Ki Refiners, or True God for Body Refiners, and then Daofather for Ki Refiners, and Elder God for Body Refiners. Finally, there is the very pinnacle of power in the Three Realms, the World level. This is the level of cultivation Pangu was at when he created the Pangu Chaosworld, and Nuwa similarly reached. While there are even higher levels of power to be grasped, they need not be mentioned for now, and you won't be able to reach them during this jump.
        On a final note, once every three hundred years after a practitioner steps into the Zifu Realm, they will be met with a minor tribulation, which will build up in power until finally, they shall face one major tribulation every nine hundred years. Three centuries a Tribulation, nine a Calamity, this shall continue until they either reach the Celestial Immortal stage, or have their souls shattered. For the purposes of this perk you'll be given a technique in both Body Refining and Ki Refining that will last you until the Wanxiang Stage, at which point you'll have to fend for yourself. For 50 CP you can get one that will allow you to advance to the Celestial Immortal and Empyrean God level, using both types of cultivation. Regardless of whether you buy the technique that allows you to train to the Celestial Immortal/Empyrean God level or not, the technique you get is of the highest quality, and you won't need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it. Your cultivation technique may be aligned towards whatever Dao you wish it to be.
        Required Secondary Abilities (0CP)
        The laws of this Universe are very different from those you are used to, and things such as moving faster than sound are possible for even the most base rank and file Yet they find themselves lacking things such as sonic booms. In this Universe and the ones you will travel to in the future, such protections will thus continue to exist. In addition to this, spending countless years on a single task, or just on living a normal life, also don't seem to be a problem for you anymore.
        * Just as a note any creatures created in the world by someone like those queens are absolutely loyalty




 --- Domain: Skills: Magitech (24) (39 Perks) --- 




-Build That Wall (Bastion) (100CP)
        You know the basics of Caelondian technology. You understand how to harness the semi mystical power of Cores and turn it into usable Mantic energy, to power basic machinery, shortrange flying machines, computers, and a variety of other uses. More interestingly, you can use Core power to reinforce existing structures, running a Matic current through it to enhance whatever physical properties it possesses, usually durability, though other uses are possible. This is what allowed structures like the Rippling Wall and the Bastion to survive the Calamity as well as they did. You also gain basic skill for mundane construction.


-Sorcery Capsules (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (100CP)
        The impossible marriage between science and magic allowed the creation of these small capsules, which purpose is to store intricate spells for their later use. Think of magical grenades with multiple types. You gain a whole dozen of these small artifacts, as well as the instructions of how to make more and fill them with all kinds of spells.


-Tech Wizard (Devil Survivor) (100CP)
        You're really good with machines. You just sort of understand how they work, better than most. But not just regular machinery, no. You've learned how magitech works too, to a certain extent. COMPs are incredibly powerful tools, allowing users to summon demons, learn magic, go beyond normal human limits, and fight on the same level as demons. You can't build one yet, but you've figured out how they work, and even how to modify the coding to a certain extent. Won't the Shomonkai be surprised to find out they're no longer safe from their own toys?


-Antimatter Manipulation Principle (Final Fantasy XIII) (200CP)
        You understand the science at work behind Cocoon's technology. You may not have the equipment to reproduce it, but you can manipulate gravity to a limited degree even without it - enough to save you from falls.
        With suitable tools however, you could make all sorts of equipment and mechanical wonders, even up to graviton cores that can maintain giant aerial defence platforms.


-Antimatter Temporal Principle (Final Fantasy XIII 3) (200CP)
        The same antimatter manipulation principle developed by the scientists of ancient Academia was banned by the Fal'Cie Pandaemonium in the recent years, and all its researchers vanished. After careful research, you've come to realize why. Through extensive manipulation, Chaos itself can be controlled with AMP, and while the degree of control you can exert on it is limited even you can stop time for five seconds at will. However, you also move at a reduced pace, as the sheer effort of manifesting this unnatural phenomenon drains you in more ways than simply energy.
        After trying this twice in rapid succession, you found yourself completely drained, but if you alone could perform such a feat even with significant support from any piece of ancient AMP technology then perhaps the Fal'Cie banned it out of fear that it would evolve to something greater
        Without this research available, and with most of the team lost, you wonder if it would have been impossible otherwise to reconstruct this technology. After all, only the significant presence of Chaos provoked the research to begin with, long after Gran Pulse had fallen.


-Light-Tech (Nexus 2.0) (200CP)
        The primary advantage common goblins make use of is technology, crossing several fields of study from alchemy to metalworking and engineering to medical sciences. However, their greatest technologies are their Light-Tech, technology that interfaces directly with their Light and other supernatural powers, such as Mist once they unlock it. By default, this allows them to focus their Light through any tech they make to enhance its function, but with practice, they can extend this to other sources of power they may possess. This can also be used on objects they didn't craft, but is instead familiar with, however it will have some loss in effectiveness the less familiar with the object they are.


-Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th (Final Fantasy XIV) (200CP)
        The Garlean use of Magitek doesn't just end with automatons. Many of the weapons, armor, and even day today objects have benefited from the implementation of magitek. Inside this textbook is a collection of theories and applications that have been tested and improved. You could most likely learn from these theories and apply the principles of magitek to any inanimate object .We've seen from live samples that Magitek doesn't just enhance the magical properties of an item it seems to add in neat little quirks like transformation sequences and magic resistant coatings as well. It's likely you could scale this up to high levels with a substantial amount of further analysis.


-Ride the Winds of Inspiration (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
        Mania, a strange phenomenon. It is not generated by geniuses alone. Instead, all kinds of mortal thought can generate low amounts of Mania, with scientific or mathematical thought generating more, and the sort of thought one might call "revolutionary" (politically, scientifically, ethically, it doesn't seem matter) generating the most. In this world there is a phenomena known as 'Maniac Storms' and thanks to your outsider's perspective you've hit upon an idea. If there are 'storms' of Mania then there must be 'winds and currents' by applying this theory to your wonders you can create wonders that need no Mania to feed on, though they still will cause Havoc in the hands of a mere mortal. This technique does rely upon the winds of mania as a whole though so be careful, it could fail in lands where the local 'winds' aren't strong enough such as a rural backwater town or an amish village. In lands without proper technology you need to look for innovation, for it really is the thought that counts.


-Sparking Innovation (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (200CP)
        The fruits of hard work and study. By studying the arts of the ancient Sheikah, You can now create basic Ancient technology. The chief use of this is that you have the knowledge of creating the blue flame that acts as the energy source for much Sheikah Tech. This Blue Flame can be used to fuel various magitech as Sheikah devices are known to be, and in turn you are capable of creating simple tools such as cameras and recording devices with this level of knowledge. Nothing ground shaking on its own, but it's the base of even greater innovation


-System Worker (Fate/Extella) (200CP)
        A position normally only entrusted to neutral Casters but the story of this world proves that's not really how it works out. The Moon Cell has decided to make you one of the system maintenance workers, Servants in charge of caring for the virtual reality within the computer structure. Superhuman skill with computers and most technology is yours now, mostly focused on repairing and maintaining it. Even alien technology, like that of Velber, is relatively easy for you to get in working order and keep it that way. You're not able to alter much, the Moon Cell keeps that knowledge out of your hands with just this, but making new stuff isn't too hard. You don't know how to create the highly complex systems that form the core of the Moon Cell but pretty much anything on Earth till the year 2030 is easy to construct. Those lunar databases are good for something.


-Technomage (Libriomancer) (200CP)
        While not a magic user per se you have the unique ability to make magic and technology play along together in just the right kind of way. Perhaps you can take a fictional operating system out of a book and install it on a real computer. Or create a self replicating swarm of nanomachines from a sliver of magically created tissue. Whatever it is, you can do it and are likely to be the envy of your magical peers.


-Technomage (Strike Witches) (200CP)
        Strike Witches generally rely on service crews to tune and repair their striker, but not you. You'll be able to do the job much better and be able to modify your Striker to aid you focus your speed, defense or attack if you have offensive magical abilities. If you have technology from other jumps, you'll be able to incorporate them into your striker and with enough time make one from scratch.


-Weird Science (Bleach) (200CP)
        While the rest of the Soul Society resembles feudal Japan, the Shinigami R&D area is the exception. Like them you can create devices that run off of spiritual power, and can, in time create mod souls as well.


-Playing with Dolls (Fate/Legends Land of the Rising Sun) (300CP)
        Ever have the ninja pushed for more tricks and tools to keep them ahead of their foes. It's only logical that their desires for a greater advantage over the raw power of the samurai would lead to such advancements in technology. The Danzou puppet is the culmination of incredible science and magic coming together as one, creating an artificial lifeform filled with the experiences and skills of many great ninja, equipped with advanced technology and powerful magic. It's also something you have the knowledge to make and more besides.
        You have the training in various disciplines to create advanced puppet bodies like this, as well as the weaponry and technology that Danzou makes use of in that body, even things like missiles. This covers both ordinary scientific knowledge and occult magecraft focused towards artificial bodies like this. It's quite possible to turn an existing person into one of these puppets, albeit more difficult than making it from scratch.
        One of the more impressive parts of this field is the techniques that allow for the recording and uploading of knowledge or skills that people possess. With a willing or incapacitated subject, you know how to examine what they know and copy it over to another person. Your studies in this field have also helped you realize how to capably combine magic with technology, creating things where the two work together to support and enhance both sides' effects instead of interfering. While you can't alter the basic metaphysics behind things such as mystery, you do know how to work it to your advantage.


-A World Is A Living Thing (Warhammer 40K - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain) (400CP)
        Among the Exodites, the Infinity Circuit is known as the World Spirit, and upon the death of an Exodite, this network absorbs their soul, thus keeping them from the clutches of Slaanesh and allowing those still living to commune with them. Now you too bear the knowledge by which one might forge this great and intricate grid of stone circles, obelisks, and menhirs. It will take some time, of course, to cover an entire world - likely more time you will have in a given journey at any rate - but it is entirely possible to produce a smaller version over say, the course of three years, protecting the souls of those within an area about the size of a small township. May the dead know peace at last.


-Artificer (Exalted - The Dragon Bloods) (400CP)
        Arguably the key reason Lookshy remains such a powerful independent nation is due to the vast stockpile of first age technology it maintains from the ruins of Deheleshen, the ruined city Lookshy was founded on. Therefore one of the key priorities of the general staff is to ensure that these artifacts are serviced and cared for properly. Because most of the skills required were lost in the usurpation, many weapons are considered one use only and as such only used in the most extreme situations. Those that can be repaired however are instrumental in maintaining the military presence of this singular city. This means that there has to be dragonblooded, skilled in artifice, dedicated to maintaining these tools; with the specialized skills and rare knowledge required to do so.
        By taking this perk, you would possess the knowledge about how to repair and maintain the complex artifacts owned by Lookshy. As well as this thanks to ages of study and practice you will have an instinctive understanding of how these wonders operate, meaning attempting to fix more advanced artifacts and creating your own will be much easier in the future.


-Bonesinger (Warhammer 40K - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain) (400CP)
        Dear child, the Eldar do not simply build their wondrous technology. Instead, they rely on the power of song to shape their creations into being. This is a very demanding process, which requires a unique mix of artistic and scientific knowledge. Most importantly of all, a strong mind is necessary for this process. Bonesingers sing a psychic song, and its melodies form a psychoactive material from the warp itself, called Wraithbone. This lightweight material is stronger than titanium but is far more flexible and weighs less. Additionally you can psychically grow crystals that are the basis of their laser & lance technology. You have the knowledge and ability to sing any Eldar technology and any technology you know into being and more than that, eons of experience in doing so. Even so, the more complex an item is, the more time it takes to create said item. A whole choir of Bonesingers is required to create large and complex items such as starships and Eldar Titans unless you are willing to sing alone for years. With enough time, perhaps, you could even sing forth a brand-new Craftworld but how and where would you acquire that much time? Even an Eldar is not immortal.


-Computation Creation (Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil) (400CP)
        The operation orb - or computation orb, if you prefer - is a masterwork of science and mathematics. A unique crystalline and clockwork structure allows for mathematical code to be stored - called spells - and channels energy from the user in order to empower them. You now understand not just how they work, but why - and in doing so, can apply the principles to other aims. Magic is currently used solely by the air corps for long range bombardment. Let's fix that, shall we?


-It Is Written (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (400CP)
        The use of mystical runes for enchanted effects is well known by those with a passing interest in the magical arts, but...the Sheikah were unique. They were able to create a language from runes that had conditional statements and effects. In short - the Sheikah could program with runes, thus allowing for programs to become spells. You have knowledge of this art as well - You are able to use Runes to code programs such as those used by the Sheikah Slate to perform its functions. This combined with Sparking Innovation would give you the groundwork to create your own variant of the Sheikah Slate with your own round of Runes...though magic doesn't make something simple - you'll need to create the code for these Slates yourself.


-Machine Madness (Dragon Ball GT) (400CP)
        So much of the universe relies on Ki to grant them power or natural biological abilities. Why pursue scientific perfection when you're already able to claim to be perfect? Why NOT pursue scientific perfection? Despite the lack of need, you buried yourself into science and found ways to use technology to match mysticism. So long as you have a good understanding of how a supernatural effect or technique or ability works, you are able to replicate it through technology, creating a device or being capable of performing that effect or technique or ability. The method, resources, cost and so on may change to fit the new medium but the ultimate result will be as if you had used that magical spell yourself...just through the lens of beautiful, beautiful science.


-Magical Science (Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil) (400CP)
        You are the forefront of mage technology, and can easily improve on what is currently being used, with some effort you can also build far more powerful mage tech. Whatever faction you belong to is sure to value you greatly.


-Moon Tech (Okami) (400CP)
        While you aren't granted a full understanding of everything the Moon Tribe could do, you've been blessed with the basics, including the method to make the metal used in their constructions, and an intuitive understanding of the way the machinery functions. For the most part, the inner workings are mostly a mystery, though what is known is that they can run infinitely on their power source and are controlled by the spirit or divine power of the user. Examples of the greatest of their technology includes Yami's nearly unbreakable transforming robot body, a machine that generates freezing blizzards, and spaceships. Lesser works include most non-divine creations in the item section. This talent could quickly grow into so much more if you could only get your hands on enough Moon Tribe relics to experiment with or an expert to learn from.
        Indeed, this is all promised to you by Yami, along with dark power unending and rule in Nippon if only you swear fealty to him and devote yourself to his goal. After all, he has already granted you so much, and without even demanding your loyalty. As a bonus, Yami will even throw in the right to manifest his markings on your body. In appearance, they're simply a blue mirror of the celestial markings worn by Brush Gods. Try not to show it off to those few who've dealt with him before, as none will hesitate in slaying an agent of Yami. I'll leave the choice up to you.


-NovaTech (Trinity:Aberrant) (400CP)
        Nova powers can fill technological gaps, allowing for devices to be constructed that are decades ahead of the curve...even if those devices won't work for anyone but the Nova that made them. While mainly the domain of Mega-intelligent scientists, you've made strides into the field of using technology that amplifies or is fuelled by a Nova's innate powers. Perhaps this is as simple as a gauntlet that helps focus and strengthen Quantum Bolts, or as complex as a massive structure that allows for a Warp- capable Nova to reach a distant star system with their power.


-There's An App For That (UQ Holder) (400CP)
        Magic Apps are a recent invention, made to bring power to the people. They turn a magical spell into an electronic format that can be inserted into a Manaphone, a device to power the spells with electricity, and then freely use that magic without doing the training or energy normally needed. Amazing stuff and you're at the forefront of that new science. You're quite effortlessly able to translate any magical spell or Ki technique that you know into a Magic App, provided you have the proper facilities, regardless of how strange or powerful the magic may be. You do still need to power the spell with something once you turn it into an App but you're well versed in the creation of Manaphones and like devices too, so you can convert almost any kind of phone or computer to be able to cast apps too.


-DigiModify (Digimon World Re: Digitize) (600CP)
        No matter how great a creation might be; you can't plan for everything when you make it. The same goes for people; as even the most skilled warrior might run into problems such as their inability to walk on water. However, through the power of SCIENCE all things are possible!
        Through acts of technological wizardry you're capable of creating special 'programs' you can 'install' in both objects and living beings to modify their abilities, or how they interact with the environment. Something like water walking would be the work of a few hours of coding; while creating a false wall would take only a few minutes.
        Greater yet is the possibility of improving lifeforms. Such as finding ways to 'overclock' them for a significant but temporary boost in ability; though the strain such things may cause will require their cautious use and application. However, with patience and a dedicated subject you can study intimately it may be possible to chip away at a creatures limitations, or program new capabilities derived from their existing traits; slowly but surely improving them through incremental steps. Though take care when doing so, as the more that you push them with a single alteration the greater the risk you expose your subject to. That said, a little danger is nothing a brilliant mind like yourself is unfamiliar with.


-Digitized Sorcery (Fate/Extra) (600CP)
        The Magi of old had to adapt, converting the dying system of magecraft into something that could be used to their advantage within the Moon Cell. The results of their efforts are the Code Casts, a digital version of magecraft. Much like them, you can now convert magical systems into a technological variant. This will not be instant and will require a fair amount of research for you to accomplish, but it would let you find a new side to existing systems you possess.


-Gadgeteer (Hellboy) (600CP)
        I mean, someone's got to make all the cool gear and equipment that the BPRD uses, right? But not only are you a skilled engineer and inventor, capable of making things like Hellboy's Samaritan revolver and the garbage truck they use in the field, but you're also able to create technology that interacts with and perhaps- with time and study- even uses some of the mystical energies found in this world, such as the detectors they use for finding magical creatures and objects. In addition, designing specialty gear meant to be used by one person such as Abe Sapien's breathing apparatus or- again- Hellboy's pistol is much easier and quicker than it would normally be.


-Magic is the Mother of Invention (The Magicians - TV Show) (600CP)
        It seems that you've been dabbling in the art of creating Magical objects, and have found yourself to be quite proficient at it! You're now a certified genius when it comes to creating and altering Magical objects, be they regularly enchanted or MagiTech, and you have enough base knowledge to create things such as state-of-the-art Magical batteries or warded objects on par with Brakebills University's wards. You invent and create new Magical objects incredibly quickly, and can easily deduce the purpose and method of usage of any Magical object given enough time.


-Magical Mechanic (Generic Buffy Fanfiction) (600CP)
        By definition, anything that exists as part of the universe is natural and is therefore subject to engineering no different than physics, chemistry, or biology. Cybernetic human/demon hybrids are certainly doable, as are computers that perform location spells and summon power from a massive reactor stored in a pocket dimension. Magic's erratic nature is never beyond a mathematical equation to account for the variance, and even spells that require a living being would easily accept one of your AIs.
        CAPSTONE BOOSTED: This now extends to any abilities you have. Your creations are inherently linked to you and are receptive to your powers. You may have trouble finding a way to provide enough energy to machines to let them wield your full power, but you at least have the means to imbue any ability, perk, or attribute into your creations.


-Magos Aetheric (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (600CP)
        Though feared and maligned, the existence of the Imperium nonetheless depends upon exploiting the immaterium. Understanding it allows for travel, for communication, and to battle the daemonic on even terms. You have come to be one of the very few experts on the subject of the warp, and know how to manipulate it through technology. You can easily craft psy-implants that boost or suppress psychic powers, weaponry incorporating psychic components, or hexagrammatic wards. With enough time and resources you could build or even improve upon existing patterns of gellar field generators, warp drives, and immaterial sensors. You have even made inroads into understanding the genetic influence behind the manifestation of psyker, pariah and navigator abilities. This is not an easy path to tread, for the slightest misstep or moment of carelessness can see you damned, and even with the most exacting precautions it is a road fraught with peril.


-Mechanica (Ars Magica) (600CP)
        In medieval Europe, Heron of Alexandria was known mostly for his philosophical works, but he also produced extensive texts on mathematics, physics and mechanics, which inspired a group of mechanic-mages known as the Mechanicians. These Mechanicians created magical mechanical beings known as Mechanica, some of which even had human-level intelligence.
        This knowledge spread throughout much of the Eastern Roman Empire, but died out in the fifth century as a result of religious persecution. You now have the knowledge and skill to revive this tradition, being capable of building Mechanica yourself. While these can be designed to perform simple mechanical tasks, they can also duplicate spell effects, and, with extra effort, they can be awakened, granting them magic resistance, the intelligence of an average human and a personality based on their form and materials.
        For example, a mechanical snake might be deceptive and prone to telling lies, while a being made from iron may be particularly stubborn. A being awakened this way begins its life very loyal to its creator, and will likely remain that way as long as it is not mistreated. Creating Mechanica does not require vis despite the fact that they will operate indefinitely if kept safe and well-maintained. The components required for their construction are very expensive, however.


-Neo Engineer (Date a Live) (600CP)
        For better or worse, your talents are more important at the back of the battle rather than in the frontlines. You're an engineer of either AST or directly of DEM Industries. Developing and upgrading CR-Units and weapons is your trade and life, even the most complex and dangerous of suits or weapons are something easy to do. But, perhaps your true talent is the skill of uniting mana and technology with extreme freedom, making breakthrough after breakthrough as long as you have the resources. Who knows, maybe with enough data you could create an artificial spirit.


-The Science of Mysticism (D.Y.N. Freaks) (600CP)
        The wonders of human ingenuity will never cease, even in a supposedly cruel world like this. You've gained the knowledge to convert magical spells into data format and upload them into technological devices, allowing those devices to cast those spells by drawing on the power the device runs on. As they have been turned into code, you are able to also alter the way the spells work to a great extent by interacting with and altering that code. Whilst you do not have unlimited freedom with these changes, it's impossible to make the spell many times as powerful as before or take away the drawbacks entirely or turn it into an entirely different spell, you can alter many of its' mechanics and rules to better suit your purposes. Make a shield spell automatically activate in certain conditions or change an elemental spell from controlling fire into one controlling another of the basic elements such as wind or water.


-Vitriolic Craftsman | Demonic Bartender | Chalcanth | Purest Vitriol | Exotic Components (Exalted - The Infernals) (750CP)
        Vitriolic Craftsman (400CP)
        The artifacts of Malfeas differ on a fundamental level from those of Creation, and as such Infernal artisans have devised many techniques to create these infernal relics. The making of such artifacts requires the pure form of the dark and acrid liquid known as vitriol, and the binding of demons into these relics, dissolving their forms and integrating their still-living Essences into their creation.
        Under an infernal artisan's ministrations, pure vitriol serves as a catalyst. Objects bathed in it are seared free of weakness, making them as strong as any of Creation's magical materials; component parts flow together and intermingle, amalgamating into a unified whole. Where an artificer in Creation would spend months carving and shaping an artifact's components, his Malfean counterpart immerses them in vitriol and guides their slow, inextricable melding. Then, one slowly integrates the dissolved form of a living demon, known as Chalcanth or Azoth depending on their power, into the device's nascent structure.
        A demon must be of sufficient stature to match the power of a relic in order to bond with it, and likewise must its nature also accord with the relic's function if the procedure is to succeed. Now you too will join the ranks of hell's greatest artisans, with knowledge and skill that encompasses vitriol itself, the acids and catalysts derived from it and its use in the crafting of infernal relics.
        Your knowledge encompasses much understanding of demonic Essence, as well as the instinctive ability to use the appropriate mundane crafts to use together with vitriol as the catalyst. Bonding the Chalcanth to a Brass blade of your own design shall be a labor almost considered easy to an craftsman of your skill. Likewise the arts of demonic magi-technology and the creation and modification of life through vitalizing essence are known and practised by you, though their applications are somewhat more complex. As one of Hell's master artisans you may even surpass the limitations of the dull and feeble demonic essence contained within your creations, to instill them with a demonic will as a true Hellforged wonder with its own intellect and awakened essence.
        Demonic Bartender (Exalted - The Infernals) (200CP)
        Demons love their liquor. As water is extremely rare and milk nearly unknown in the demon realm, Hell instead offers a thousand infernal wines, whiskeys, brandies, vodkas and other drinks. Many of them contain other drugs, both natural and supernatural. Some are flat-out toxic to mortals. Still, those Exalts who cultivates an immunity to poison and cast-iron gullet can explore a world of strange intoxicants that range from gut-ripping vileness to soul-shuddering delight. You've gained an understanding on how to create all these brews yourself. How to ferment bone-wine, thanachvil, and gurshant. How to distill liquid emotions and waking dreams derived from Hegra's rains into elixirs. How to bottle the perfect pleasure that is sypax, or the liquid Lethe of final rest elixir... and finally, even the most precious drink in all of Malfeas, chalcanth. chalcanth is the liquefied, distilled essence of a demon. The unfortunate demon is dissolved in pure vitriol while still alive, so that drinking chalcanth is like tasting pure Being to a demon, and grants both Essence and memories to any who drink it. Of course if you'd prefer, it could also be used in forging infernal relics, by far the most common artifacts in hell.
        Chalcanth (50CP)
        The life force of a demon preserved in vitriol, chalcanth appears as a cupful of vibrant liquid. The color and consistency of any given dose varies with its origin, but the fluid always stirs restlessly of its own accord and issues a faint susurrus, as the demon liquified in its creation still lives. Chalcanth's primary purpose is the creation of infernal relics, but that is not its only use. Many in Malfeas seek it out as an intoxicating source of essence, because if one drinks it they will be energized as the flavors of the demon's mind and soul tumble through the drinker's brain in a synesthetic wash of images and emotions. With one purchase of this, you will gain a cupful of high quality Chalcanth once every five days.
        Purest Vitriol (50CP)
        Passive and reactive in nature, Vitriol was designed by the Primordials to catalyze evolutionary transformation in matter and Essence. But in the millennia since the Primordial War, the Yozis' loathing for their jailers, their captivity, and their own broken natures has permeated the very nature of vitriol, infusing it with their hate. Now, it consumes all that it encounters. The stuff bubbles in open pits laden with the detritus of all that it has dissolved, and these impurities must be removed before the vitriol may be used for magical purposes. With one purchase of this, you will gain a weekly supply of enough pure Vitriol to dissolve a demon in or baptise one relic smaller than a vehicle.
        Exotic Components (50CP)
        Artificers of hell construct their relics with a greater pool of exotic reagents than those of Creation-made artifacts, for the world-bodies of the Yozi are rich with alien metals, stones and woods, not to mention the tissues and excretions of countless species of lesser demons, animals, plants and other entities that mortal savants might not even recognize as life. Of course, while these many be easy to come across in hell itself, not all Infernals have the luxury of staying there whenever they work on their relics. So with one purchase of this, you will gain a starting wealth of exotic components and an additional weekly supply of more than enough to construct a lesser relic, straight from the Demon Realm.


-Thing of Wonder | Foaly? Koboi? Jumper (Artemis Fowl) (1100CP)
        Thing of Wonder (500CP)
        You're brilliant. That's just the best way to say it. You are simply an incredibly, unbelievably clever person. Your memory is a thing of wonder, with unlimited storage, perfect indexing and recall. You have a perfect sense of time and schedules, being able to keep perfect track of any number of things at all times. Your brain and nervous system is such that your thoughts can travel ridiculously, mind-bogglingly fast, giving you a peerless speed of processing info. You can control this, to prevent going nuts from boredom if nothing else. Not that you would, your patience is inexhaustible and infinite, though your reflexes remain sharp through any length of time. You can focus on any number of things at once, working at all of them as if you were working on that thing alone. Your analysis and comprehension skills are similarly ridiculous, being practically miraculous. Patterns and puzzles unravel in front of you, revealing their secrets almost as if they want to, to you. You can analyze legal cases, codes, riddles and puzzles, conspiracies and schemes, and break them in less time than it takes most people to figure out what is happening at all. There is no code you can't break, no pattern you can't identify. This perk is a Capstone Booster, meaning it enhances each of the origin capstones if taken with this. The details are mentioned in the perk descriptions.
        Foaly Koboi Jumper (600CP)
        You're a genius among geniuses, in technology and magic both. Your technological skill is such that you find it child's play to create gadgets and weapons like Bio-Bombs, or the technological wonders that are LEP uniforms, or small devices that make toy cars nuclear-powered. You can even improve them or come up with more tech of similar levels, if not even more advanced. You're also a hacker of absolutely unmatched skill, capable of slicing through any and all systems, firewalls and defenses like a knife through butter, bending networks and websites to your will, and all the rest that comes with it. It doesn't matter how advanced or sophisticated it is, if it's electronic or digital and it can be accessed at all, you can penetrate all aspects of it until you control it outright - it's just a matter of time and effort. And very little of either, really. Your skills at magic are nothing less, either. Well, if you can do it at all. If you can, then your talent is nothing short of legendary, allowing you to master spells and rituals that would take other a lifetime in days, if not less. Your skills are distributed equally in all fields of magic, so much so that any advancement in one area automatically improves the others too. You could do things like study necromancy for a month and come out tossing lightning bolts like a pro.
        Capstone Boost Both your scientific and magical abilities get a massive boost, advancing you several times over in both fields. In addition, they work together now, making you an expert in making technology that mimics magic and vice-versa. You know how to create both technology and magic to do anything and everything you yourself are capable of doing. Spells to replace devices, vice-versa, and products that use both, that is, techno-magic. You're also capable of reverse engineering any and all magic and technology you encounter, now. No matter how advanced the tech or how obscure the magic, how powerful and complicated they may be, all you need is one look at any magic or technology to know the underlying principles under it, and how to recreate, modify and improve it in a hundred different ways.


-Mega Bomb | Guru (Chrono Trigger) (1200CP)
        Mega Bomb (600CP)
        Magic and Technology are both capable of some pretty fantastic things. So why not put them together, and see what happens? You now understand the secret to integrating magic seamlessly into your mechanical devices, enabling you to create devices like bombs powered with fire magic or medkits that use healing magic. While initially your devices will be one-shots that rely on a magical charge you have to deliver, in time, you'll learn how to make much more advanced fusions, such machines that run on magical power sources, or automated spellcasting devices. In the end, the only limit is your skill with machinery and magic.
        Guru (600CP)
        Back in the glory days of Zeal, Guru was a title reserved only for the most skilled and knowledgeable of their mages and scientists. You might not be there yet, but when I'm done with you, you'll be well on your way to deserving the title. Magic is akin to a science to you, letting you delve into the secrets of sorcery the same way a physicist would unlock the secrets of the atom. This also includes learning how to apply magical knowledge like an engineer does the sciences, letting you come up with breathtaking magical wonders. The Blackbird, the Mammon Machine, the Ocean Palace - who knows what you'll add to that list of legends.


-Device Meister | Mysterious Serum | Ancient Knowledge (Lyrical Nanoha) (1300CP)
        Device Meister (600CP)
        This is the real treasure of the TSAB's technological capabilities - mixing the use of magic and technology inorder to create Devices that can channel the energy outwards. You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use.
        While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn't included here - you'll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of 'SimilarPrinciples' to streamline the process...it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough.
        Mysterious Serum (300CP)
        Fascinating. These test tubes contain a colorless serum that, when ingested, allow one to 'awaken' the Linker Cores of sentient beings, allowing them to naturally use this world's magic after a little bit of training with it. Note that individuals like Nanoha are exceptions to the rule, and will be in future worlds as well - unless they had a particular affinity for magic or some way to boost their arcane power, you're unlikely to find anyone who starts with a Natural Ability higher than A. You receive eight of these, along with the formula on how to create more - though it's encoded and you'll have to decipher it. If you have 'Ancient Knowledge', you already know how to make more on your own from the get-go. Magical ability growth for individuals outside of this world tend to plateau at S-rank on their own. Bear that in mind.
        Ancient Knowledge (400CP)
        The legacy of the Belkan Empire exists not merely within ruins or Lost Logia, but in the blood of its people. You have inherited a bloodline of note, and while it may or may not be one of the canonical or major bloodlines, a piece of it has followed you in your very DNA, subconsciously nudging at your memory. While this creates no stress or strain on your personality, the connection is diluted enough that you can't consciously access this memory...but when you come into contact with Lost Logia, you will rapidly gain insight into how it functions and possibly ways to engineer it once again. You will need actual technical skills to pull this off, but with a little bit of time, perhaps you can restore what is lost? Post-jump, this same insight applies to 'lost' or 'forgotten' technology, though you will likely need other sources of knowledge and abilities to truly restore it, depending on its complexity. May or may not come with brief instances of acting and speaking like a resident of the Belkan Empire at random intervals.


-Magical Coding | Coding Station | Spell Compendium | CAD Tuning | Taurus Silver (The Irregular At The Magic Highschool) (1400CP)
        Magical Coding (100CP)
        The Activation Sequences used to enact Modern magic are made up of large blocks of code translated into Magic Sequences by the Magician's Magic Calculation Area. You know the basics of this world's coding methods, allowing you to program simple Activation Sequences into a CAD and create simple hacking programs.
        Coding Station (200CP)
        This is the workhorse of a Magic Engineer, being their main 'battle station' so to speak. This large desk comes equipped with an integrated computer and CAD connection system to code Sequences into CADs and tune them to their user. It also possesses a simple VI system to make coding easier and more efficient. Includes a CAD can take almost any form you want, from a bracelet to a pendant to a stick, and store up to 99 different Activation Sequences though it's usually less precise than a specialized CAD.
        Spell Compendium (100CP)
        This small PDA-like device contains a large selection of Activation and Magic Sequences for your personal use. Secret or unique Sequences cannot be included in this selection.
        CAD Tuning (400CP)
        Tuning a CAD to the specifics of its owner's Psion wave profile enables it to function at peak efficiency, reducing Psion waste and improving connectivity. You can do the same for most artifacts you own, calibrating them to improve their connections to you, slightly boosting their power and efficiency.
        Taurus Silver (600CP)
        Taurus Silver is a noun collectively used by two different people, Tatsuya Shiba and Ushiyama, and is the head of the Third Division of Four Leaves Technology, with Tatsuya handling the software side and Ushiyama the hardware side. You are now of the same caliber as them, being either a very effective professional code-builder or engineer, capable of assembling new forms of codes or creating new types of machines capable of grand things when brought together, like Tatsuya's Loop Cast System or Ushiyama's Silver Series CADs. If taken with Strategic-Class Magician, you can have both specialties at higher levels than even Tatsuya of Ushiyama, and you also gain a powerful affinity for magitech of all forms.


-MineFactory Reloaded | Industrialcraft | Buildcraft | Railcraft | Lore of Alex | Nethereye (Minecraft) (1450CP)
        MineFactory Reloaded (600CP)
        Your understanding of magic is complete. To you, magic is engineering, and can be automated and reproduced on an Industrial scale... at a considerable cost in life, as this sort of magitech runs not merely on Electricity, but also on the life Essence extracted from the bodies of the dying. This liquid Essence permits the manufacture of potions and enchanted items on an automated assembly line, or the breakdown of enchanted items into Essence and component materials. This can even extend to potions and enchanted items from other universes, provided you have mastered the relevant techniques, and have enough of the required raw materials to make automation worthwhile.
        IndustrialCraft (400CP)
        Working your way up from simple machines, you are able to build a vast array of advanced machinery, from the humble ore grinding Macerator, to the futuristic Mass Fabricator. In time, you'll be able to build automated factory complexes, supply all your power needs with nuclear energy, protect yourself with nigh impervious Quantum Armour, teleport between bases with ease, and terraform vast areas to suit your whims.
        Buildcraft (200CP)
        You aren't limited to building things yourself given some basic supplies and some redstone, you can use a system of gears and tubes to automate your crafting tables, create an item sorting system, and build massive automated quarries capable of stripping the land of all resources down to the bedrock. It'll take a bit to get started, but once you're up and running, you'll be sure to have all the resources you need.
        Railcraft (100CP)
        Instead of the crude minecart tracks you were able to make before, you are now able to make properly sturdy rails, able to bear the weight of full Steampowered trains that can pull a variety of useful carts. Using a system of tracks and automatic loader/unloaders, you can automate the delivery of resources and liquids from one place to another, or deploy 'railgun' systems to launch explosive filled carts at your enemies! You can even create trains which automatically build their own tracks, or which dig tunnels for you. You'll also be able to make massive steam boilers, with which you can power your Buildcraft devices far more efficiently... given a nontrivial setup process.
        Lore of Alex (100)
        You know the mystic secrets of this world, and can easily assemble a portal to the Nether, given a supply of Obsidian. Should you acquire the necessary hellish reagents there, you'll be able to brew a number of useful magical potions. Additionally, whenever you kill something, glowing orbs will emerge from the corpse, which will float towards you if you are close enough with enough of these (and a diamond studded Enchanting Table), you'll be able to enchant items with a variety of simple magical powers. It is notable that all these effects work generally in this world, and anyone can learn them here you just know it all from the start, and will be able to apply these effects with confidence in other worlds, or to things not normally found in this world. For instance, you'll be able to judge the enchantment capacity of arbitrary items with a glance, and that amount will be greater for you than it might be for other magi.
        Nether Eye (50)
        You'll be able to craft Nether Eyes from Ender Pearls and Magma Cream, which will allow you to easily locate Nether Fortresses, when you visit the Nether. You'll also have a pretty solid grasp of Overworld/Nether geometry, thus allowing you to 'safely' use Nether Portals as 'shortcuts' between distant parts of the overworld. Additionally, Nether Portals will work in nonMinecraft worlds, guaranteeing you access to Nether only resources like Glowstone and Nether Wart. Caution: use of Nether Portals in universes which contain actual hell dimensions may send you there instead.
        * Buildcraft, Industrialcraft and lore of alex are all required to make minefactory reloaded work. Railcraft and nethereye could be removed if wanted. This would save 150CP. They are add ons to buildcraft and lore of alex




 --- Domain: Skills: Magic (25) (65 Perks) --- 




-I Can Read Your Aura (Eureka-Warehouse 13-Alphas) (100CP)
        Everyone has an Aura, and being able to sense them allows you insight into a person's mental and emotional state. Incidentally, Artefacts also have an Aura, and the ability to sense them allows you a unique insight into the correct placement of Artefacts within the Warehouse, to ensure the energies of the Artifacts do not react badly with each other.


-Magic Style: Arc of Embodiment (Fairy Tail) (100CP)
        It's time to choose the Magical Styles that you have already learned upon entering this world. Whilst most magical styles can be learned with time and effort and the right teacher or source of knowledge, buying them here will allow them to benefit from the skill that Magic Skill ranks grant as well as allow access to extremely rare or lost magics or magics that require certain traits to use. A list of the magics that can be bought as well as their costs can be found at the end of the jump document. It should be noted that some Magic Styles will not be purchaseable through this option. Most of these are Holder Type magics, which all deal with magical items that are offered for purchase in the item section, and some are simply Caster Type magics that are too unique and either offered as part of a separate perk or not at all. This may change in the future as the series progresses or not.


-Old Patient Magic (Circle of Magic) (100CP)
        You have learned how to cast charms, wards, and protections over places that grow more and more powerful, stable, and harder to damage with age. A door you reinforced with magic a year ago will be tougher than one you reinforced a day ago, and a scrying mirror you made decades ago will be able to see further than one you made a couple years back. The growth rate may not be much, and it grows slower over time, but it does add up over decades and centuries.


-Anima (Ravenwood) (200CP)
        The power of your own soul. Wisps of spiritual energy bound to yourself, able to be shaped into quasi-physical garb or used to reinforce that which you already possess. Each shaped bit or aspect of yourself acts as a receptacle for the wisps you possess, and filling them increases the strength provided, but limits the amount you can put elsewhere. However, it only takes a few moments, vital in any battle, to shift these wisps around and change the boons they provide.


-Common Magic (Nexus 2.0) (200CP)
        Light is something everyone has, regardless if they are a fighter or not. As such, even the most common laborer will use it to their advantage. You find your abilities are easier to use when turned towards a profession that doesn't involve fighting. Crafting, farming, construction, cooking, and any other profession is able to benefit from your various abilities with great ease.


-Conceptual Fertilization (Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon) (200CP)
        The secret art of Conceptual Fertilization is one that may seem a bit strange and even unnatural to those not as invested as you in the mystic arts but...well, they don't complain so much when you show them the results. Conceptual Fertilization refers to a very rare magical ability that allows one to combine two things during the creation process of one of those things, transferring the qualities of the second thing onto the first. Combining the blood of a dragon with a infant in the womb to grant them the magical power of that dragon as they grow up, for instance. With time and further mastery, it may even be possible to combine more than one thing in this way, though one cannot begin to think of the sacrifices the failed attempts might cause. Additionally, you find that you are also able to perform this process on other things in their creation process, not just living beings, allowing you to infuse weapons or other objects in the process of being created with the traits of other things.


-External Influence (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (200CP)
        Creepy. You can now use your EVO and any relevant perks to evolve creatures and beings other than yourself. The cost to do so is less than it would take for you to make the same changes, letting you change small handfuls of individuals at a time for the same cost. This ability only works on willing or helpless targets.


-Kiln (Ravenwood) (200CP)
        You are what is known as a Kiln, capable of wielding Delfire. Often called scavenger's magic, Delfire is the combination of different forms of magic that has taken on new properties, becoming a small orb surrounded by an oddly colored flame-like aura. This is the source of delfire's name, and they do not emphasize fire over any other element. You are able to store these orbs of delfire within yourself, giving you resistance to disease, poison, curses, and corruption as it is eaten away by the delfire. Additionally, delfire acts as a spell matrix, capable of producing unusual effects when fueled by any type of energy. If you possess the Natural Magic perk, you may create orbs of Delfire by mixing various energies together. Post jump, you will be able to come across new orbs of Delfire naturally if you wish, however it is up to you whether the delfire spawns in the setting.


-Magic Repository (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (200CP)
        Fun fact: mice are excellent catalysts for magic rituals since they naturally accumulate and store magic within their bodies. Like mice, you can find it easy to store magic and other energies in your body, essentially increasing your overall storage capacity. It also becomes easier for you to naturally absorb magic and energy from your surroundings. And unlike mice, you aren't locked out from actually using/releasing the magic you build up inside you, so don't worry about that.


-Runic Spell Innovator (World Seed) (200CP)
        Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for Blast and Fire to make a fireball, or use the do the same with the Reinforce and Mind runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over your mana, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing hello world and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience. Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it's bashing someone's head in with the Force rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach.


-The Dark Crystal (Azeroth) (200CP)
        Draenei use crystals that are, possibly, native to their homeworld for almost all aspects of their daily lives. Even their technology, magic, and homes are made of these crystals. Certain Artificers are capable of 'Programming' these crystals to do certain things ranging from protecting an entire city in a shield or powering magitek spaceships that can travel the void of space. You now have their knowledge of these ancient arts and are capable of incorporating this magitek into your own technology or magic.


-Wizard (Dresden Files) (200CP)
        You're a full-fledged member of the White Council, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that entails. A lot of times that's more hassle than it's worth, especially with a war on, but there's a lot of resources you can call on when you need to, as long as you're prepared to repay the favor when need be. What this background really gets you is the full training a wizarding background offers, which has left you able to call on the entire array of everything magic is capable of. And, with enough time and preparation, there's very little which doesn't fit within that category. One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in "When all you have is a hammer" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.
        1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.
        2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.
        3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.
        4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.
        5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line.
        6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands.
        7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the "local" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters.
        Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree.
        They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.


-Signum Linguistics (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (300CP)
        Also called Symbol Magic. It's one of China Sorrows' specialties. Harnesses a magical language to produce a wide variety of effects. Fairly unique in that it can be learned by anyone, even if they've already chosen their discipline. As such, this magic can be purchased regardless of how many others you've bought already, even without Multidisciplinary Magic.
        Sorrows: Your talent is equal to that of China Sorrows, the world's most well-known user of this discipline. With this, you have become capable of producing greater effects than before. From producing waves of energy to masquerading as another, you can do it all. You can even carve sigils into your very body without a single worry of a mistake. Using this power, you could even seal others' True Names, provided they meet the requirements for doing so, of course. What you can do now is virtually limitless, as long as you know the right runes. And if the runes you want don't exist, you can always just invent your own.
        * Think this needs the capstone booster from the same jump.


-Profession: Inscription (Azeroth) (350CP)
        Enchanting, Inscription, Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Engineering, Leatherworking, Tailoring, and Jewelcrafting. Your first purchase is half off and starts you off at an apprentice level. For an additional 50 CP you start off at a Journeyman level with all blueprints of that level and lower. For another 50 CP you will jump up to Expert with all blueprints of that level and lower. For a final purchase of 50 CP you will be an Artisan (the highest level in the game before this system was removed) with all blueprints for your profession(s) that exist within the game.


-All Magic Affinity (In Another World With My Smartphone) (400CP)
        Like what it implies, you have an Affinity with all types of magic, including all types of Null magic. This means that you have the (possibly unique) ability to use all types of magic in the world, needing only to know the chant needed to activate it and a general idea of what the magic is supposed to do. For example by knowing that the Gate spell requires the chant of gate and that it is a spell that opens a portal to a place you have already been you would be capable of casting that spell. You carry this ability to quickly learn and master all forms of magic to future worlds and systems.
        Leaving that aside your magic is tremendously potent and you have a monstrous amount of magical energy, enough that you could chain cast extremely powerful spells affecting incredible numbers of people without even noticing fatigue, much less actually suffering from such. In fact unless and until someone tells you that magical fatigue is supposed to be a thing after casting a lot of magic you probably won't even realize there's supposed to be a limit on how much magic a person can use.


-Ambient Magic: Stone (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        Stone: The most common form of Earth Magic, this magic allows stonesensing, the ability to communicate with and move stone (with permission), communication with and limited protection from volcano spirits, bringing light and heat to stones or crystals, identification of stone as well as nonstone materials similar to stone (Pearl, Coral, etc), increasing the malleability of stone, and even (in extremis) self petrification. It is practiced by Evvy and Jebilu Stoneslicer. Working in stone is difficult, and their ability to shape stones isn't as fine as other craft mages, but the tradeoff is that they tend to last much longer than those of others. Since stones have long memories, scrying the past is relatively easy for stonemages.


-Ambient Magic: Carpentry (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        A form of Earth Magic, it allows the magical shaping of wood, the identification of wood, the strengthening of processed wood, the softening of processed wood, and the sensing of weaknesses within wooden objects. It is practiced by Niamara Bancanor, Camoc Oakborn, and Arnen.


-Ambient Magic: Cooking (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        A form of Fire Magic, Chef Magic draws power from all aspects of cooking and the manipulation of fire. A Chef Mage's senses of taste and smell are incredibly precise, able to accurately judge both contents and quantities of ingredients. A Chef mage can, in defiance of that age old adage, pull some or all of an ingredient out of a dish with enough concentration. They can enhance flavors, healthiness, or even how much sustenance someone gains. They are also extremely skilled with knives. It is practiced by Jorality Bancanor, Olennika Potcracker, and Gorse.


-Ambient Magic: Glass (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        A form of Fire Magic, in which the user creates unique glass objects with magical abilities (eg. scrying orbs or tracker / warning pellets), as well as identification of glass works without sight through the piece's own knowledge of its form. It is practiced by Kethlun Warder. Glassmages can make lenses and mirrors that grant extrasensory abilities, such as the ability to see magic or track footprints. They can also make warded or incredibly strong windows.


-Ambient Magic: Painting (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        Although nothing is known of them, it is known that there are Ambient Mages with power over Painting, Pottery, Horses, and Birds. Rumors say there is also an Ambient Magic of Hunting, but that may be little more than legend.


-Ambient Magic: Pottery (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        Although nothing is known of them, it is known that there are Ambient Mages with power over Painting, Pottery, Horses, and Birds. Rumors say there is also an Ambient Magic of Hunting, but that may be little more than legend.


-Ambient Magic: Smith (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        A form of Fire Magic, it allows the sensing and manipulation of metals, ores, and other materials used in Smithing (like coal), resistance to fire and burning metal, resistance to smoke damage to lungs, and varying levels of fire manipulation. It is practiced by Daja and Dedicate Frostpine. Not only are Smithmages immune to normal fire and being pierced by nonmagical metal, they can craft supernaturally sharp blades, future scrying mirrors, and any number of charms from engraved metal or twisted wire.


-Aura Surgeon (World Seed) (400CP)
        One thing that all beings and objects in Neolife possess, and soon those in the real world as well, considering that exposure to mana leads to its manifestation, is an Aura. You could consider it a magical blueprint of how something works. And it truly shows everything: skills, abilities, physical makeup, personality, memory, and much more. Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram. One peculiarity of Aura is that any of its changes are reflected in the being or object possessing the Aura. Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example.
        It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It's good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won't ever happen. It wouldn't be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan.
        So long as you have an example to study, you'll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms. After studying a massive amount of different Auras to get a feel for how they work, you'll even be able to go so far as to create original Auras and beings, or change parts of your Aura to give yourself entirely new abilities.


-Create Zombie (JoJo) (400CP)
        You can infuse a corpse with a small ounce of your blood, twisting them into a vampiric minion of yours called a Zombie. They have the Blood Vessel Needle ability, and any other abilities they used in life. A Zombie can be made from any sort of corpse, so long as the circulatory system is intact. Zombies retain all qualities they had in life, including intellect.


-Forged Of Gods (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (400CP)
        The powers of the light have their own strengths of course, among those is the ability to create hero gates through which no evil may pass, you also can now create these portals, with enough preparation it is possible to create hero gates strong enough to pass a small army through. This also grants you the knowledge of how to craft weapons and items out of adamantine, a metal that is made of the remains of a dead god, and even allows you to forge otherwise unbreakable metals as if they were steel.


-From Trinitite to Powerstones (GURPS Technomancer) (400CP)
        The world of Technomancer does not stand still, and science marches forever onward, even when mana gets involved. And perhaps one of the best ways to march onward is to steal liberally from natural phenomena. You can, by examining a natural magical effect for a few days, figure out how to replicate that phenomena with a spell.


-Merge (Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath) (400CP)
        Want a bigger, better, badder copy of something you already have? Look no further. This allows you to permanently merge items together, even CP items, but the more dissimilar they are, the more potential power is lost in the merge. Two magic swords would usually stack their power, but a magic sword and a magic bow combining would be reduced to one form and reduce the power of the final item a fair amount, though it would still be more powerful than either original. You can't do more than double the power of the strongest original item merged in this way, but you could add lots of bells and whistles that don't directly make it more powerful such as additional elemental affinities. Items that are designed to be merged (like gems) do not have the limitation of doubling their starting power, so if you merge 64 level one gems, you will end up with a level 6 gem.


-Mystic Eyes of Permanence (Generic Isekai) (400CP)
        Your unusual blood has manifested in the form of a unique set of eyes. These eyes give you the ability to see the structure of magical effects, and spend your own mana to optimize those effects, extending their duration indefinitely. You can create magical flames that burn without fuel, force walls that endure for years, enchantments that never fade, perpetual constructs, and more. Magic you create or modify with the Eyes can still be broken or dispelled, but will remain forever if left undisturbed.


-Natural magic (Ravenwood) (400CP)
        People are not the only things afflicted with the corruptive influence of the Demiplane, the trees, the stone, the metal, everything possesses some degree of taint from this cursed plane of existence. And now you can use that to your advantage. You possess an innate understanding towards the mystical properties of nearly all materials within (and outside) the Demiplane, and how to shape them. By cutting gems, forming metal, grinding stone, and putting all the disparate pieces together, you can create artificial spell matrices that naturally generate and collect magical energies and can shape them into spell effects. While not often the prettiest things around, these artifacts are capable of granting magic to even the uninitiated. However, it takes precise craftsmanship and extensive design periods to make even basic items.
        This perk also extends to the creation of potions. These are much simpler to create compared to artifacts, requiring only the right herbs, water, and a catalyst of magical energy, which can be provided by even the most basic of spell matrices. Additionally, any similar skills in future jumps, can be replicated with study using this perk.


-Portal Creation (Generic Builder) (400CP)
        While every Builder can eventually learn to create portals through research or scanning enough other examples, you start knowing how to craft portals and you're particularly good at doing it cheaply both in terms of magic and in terms of material. Not only that but you have a knack for creating portals with interesting access restrictions that are almost impossible to bypass if you so choose.


-Portalist (Timespinner) (400CP)
        Vilete once knew the secret for making portals that were capable of spanning interplanetary distances, and now, you know that secret as well. You have the knowledge and skill to be able to craft portals between different locations in space. Something within the range of a city can be done 'freestyle', using only your own Aura, though you may need to charge up energy beforehand. Longer range portals would need anchors and magical focuses, but you know how to craft such very easily. Through practice and study, the range of your personal portals and permanent portals can both expand, with personal portals eventually reaching intercontinental distances, while your permanent portals could eventually reach between stars.


-Power! Unlimited Power! (Lords of the Nights - Liches) (400CP)
        While many Liches eventually become true believers in the cause, that's not how they started out. Their roots go back to hidden corners where a young wizard with more ambition and curiosity than sense discovered lore they weren't ready for, and started off on a journey to seize true might. Maybe some grow beyond that, but most don't. Whatever is the case, your magical growth is potent and many faceted. You can craft anything a mortal wizard could - any feat of craftsmanship short of the epic is yours. The understanding is solid enough to act as a prerequisite for you seeking more transcendent craftsmanship.
        You may also freely add a certain level of metamagic to anything you cast - up to the same limit as what you can cast normally. A Wizard who can cast fourth level spells could freely add up to four circles worth of metamagic without making the spell harder to cast. This empowerment doesn't need to happen in advance, and can instead be applied to spells as they are cast, taking no extra time to do so. Lastly, whenever they deepen their connection to the Arcane, more aspects of magic reveal themselves. Every Arcane 'Feat' they achieve, helps them achieve another three feats of magic - Metamagic, Reserve, Spell Penetration, or something else appropriate.


-Seed Weaving (Nexus 2.0) (400CP)
        The technique known as Seed Weaving is an advanced form of Seed Sorcery, specifically in the creation of the Seed itself. You cycle Seeds around and through each other, effectively linking them into a sort of braid, which has the effect of growing each Seed slightly faster. However, the main benefit of this technique lies in the increased flexibility, as each Seed may be Cracked to fuel each other rather than simply their own effect, even combining their effects if multiple Seeds are Cracked at once. This technique also frees any Seeds so they may move within the user's Light, allowing it to be moved and used to enhance the body when it normally wouldn't be able to, a fact that makes hunters that know this technique quite dangerous to fight as they can maintain far more Seeds than more restricted Seed Sorcerers. The process to learn this technique is difficult, requiring years of training to accomplish, and most won't be able to do more than a single Weaving at once. You, however, are skilled in the technique, able to weave up to four Seeds in a single Weaving and up to three such Weavings at the same time. You may teach others to use this technique.


-Thaumcraft (Minecraft) (400CP)
        You are a powerful mage, and can break items down into their pure Aspects, then reweave those Aspects into more useful forms. With time and research, you'll be able to transmute items into other items, create powerful magical items, imbue wands with spells both useful and deadly, and create golem servitors to carry out your whims. Beware, though; Thaumaturgy is a delicate art, and any mistakes can Taint the land, twisting the land to evil and all creatures within it into deadly and malicious forms. The Thaumonomicon, a magical book you'll create early on in your research, will help you get started, and give hints as to what to do next.


-The Ancient Music (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
        Underlying all of reality and even the Void is a musical phenomenon, and study of this underpinning force is something you have devoted your life so far to. As a result, you can design and build devices to take advantage of a 17-note scale derived from this music - the orgels the Overseers hold in such high regard being the most obvious application. If you are able to reproduce the notes correctly, they will disrupt the effect of foul magicks around you - actually, any magics at all, foul or fair. Singing bone charms will become silent, witches will no longer be able to draw on their supernatural oddities, and creatures made with magic - partially or whole - will be unable to approach you while the notes play. With the right device, you can even use the scale to project blasts of sound to knock back and disorient witches who keep their distance. While the effect is a blanket one, disrupting all magic, friend's or foe's, with significant research you could discover harmonies or sub-scales in order to affect only certain types of magic.


-Spiritual Array Master | Book of Array Diagrams | Cultivation (The Great Ruler) (500CP)
        Spiritual Array Master (400CP)
        Making a Spiritual Array is simply a special method of resonating Spiritual Energy. It will activate the Spiritual Aura within the world, creating both offensive and defensive measures. Spiritual Arrays are made up of Spiritual Seals. The more powerful and talented someone is, the more seals they can make. The more complex the array, the more seals are needed. Seal masters are divided into 9 ranks, 1 to 9, each much harder to reach than the last, though the actual ranks are slightly more complicated after the 5th rank. Few people will even be able to reach the 5th rank. Despite it sounding simple, once you get to the threshold of a rank making the next seal becomes much harder, similar to making a breakthrough in cultivation.
        You have been trained up to 3rd rank, able to create more than 100 seals. Nothing groundbreaking but impressive nonetheless. But you also have an advantage that would make many envious; you have the potential to enter the Heart Array State at will, allowing you to improve your array skills extremely quickly, as well as increasing your ability in its use while in the state. Keep training and you can eventually enter the higher forms of it like the Heart Eye State which greatly increases your array capability.
        Book of Array Diagrams (100CP)
        Having the ability to create and summon array seals is all well and good, but it is next to useless if you do not know any of the ways to arrange them in order to create an array. There are hundreds of different kinds of arrays one can make and a single misstep will cause your array to collapse. This book that you have found yourself with contains the formula for several arrays of your skill level. This book also gives details into creating your own arrays and a bit into how they work. A good starter guide if you ever wanted to teach others. These arrays will range from defensive ones, to attacking ones, to illusion ones.
        Cultivation (0CP)
        You gain the ability to cultivate, starting off at the Spiritual Movement Stage. The cultivation of the Great Thousand Worlds is Spiritual Power. If you happen to have already cultivated Dou Qi from Battle Through The Heavens, you will find that the Dou Qi has the unique ability to convert itself into the purer Spiritual Power. This means that you can essentially choose to integrate your two cultivations together and boost your Spiritual Power to high levels immediately, or keep them separate. The cultivation of the Thousand Worlds goes several realms higher than that of Dou Qi, so it can become much stronger. There are 12 stages of the cultivation of Spiritual Power, with each stage being split into a variety of levels. In the more backwater places, you would be lucky to find someone who has reached the level of Heavenly Fusion, while in the more populated areas it is not uncommon to find Sovereign class cultivators.
        In the Spirit Stage of the Spiritual Energy cultivation path, one has the ability to ingest the Soul Essence of a Spiritual Beast. However, there is a limit to the Soul Essence. As you get stronger, the Soul Essence that you have refined before will gradually lose its effect. This means that most essences will lose their effect before the Heavenly Completion Stage. However, if the Soul Essence that you have refined is powerful enough, the power will still remain even in the later level, giving those that have them an edge.
        Reaching the Sovereign Stage marks a major change in your cultivation. One must pass through 3 'disasters' where your body, energy, and soul are refined to a higher grade, yet failure is easy and can carry fatal consequences. Once you reach pass these trials and reach the Sovereign stage you will gain the Sovereign Sea, which is a much more powerful container for your Spiritual Power. The spiritual energy itself of Sovereign Masters possesses unique attributes. Some people's spiritual energies are cold in nature, and some are blazing hot. This is because their spiritual energies have their own sagacities depending on what kind of energies they take in and have attuned it to.
        Sovereigns also gain the ability to cultivate a Sovereigns Body which, depending on the rank, can give them great physical power. There are certain Celestial Body techniques one can cultivate to gain a more powerful Sovereigns Body, though they are often closely guarded secrets of clans.
        By pouring your Spiritual Power into someone else, you can awaken their ability to cultivate, not that that will do them much good without further guidance.


-Celestial Kabbalah (Unsong) (600CP)
        You have a deep understanding of the relationships between higher powers and base reality, the mechanisms that make the intangible tangible. What this means for you is that you can intuitively perceive the operations and organizational forces underpinning the universe around you; this includes conventional physics, but also more abstract forces such as destiny, Adam Kadmon, narrative causality, the operations of any magic systems, and more. With this deep insight, you can reach into the beating heart and grinding gears of these forces if you dare and manipulate them, or even carry out works of truly cosmic engineering. You might hedge out natural law, alter the parameters of a magic system and adjust its limits, rejigger the mechanisms of fate and destiny, or even run your own universe by means of magic or technology.


-Crystal Magic (Avernum) (600CP)
        The magic of the Vahnatai a hidden and enigmatic race, you can manipulate Crystals to use them for magic. It is a powerful art, capable of making anything from magical grenades, to Crystals that act as a focus for magic, to even enshrining a person's soul into a crystal, and more.


-Crystal Working (Geneforge) (600CP)
        You intrinsically know how to work crystals and form them into useful magical systems, if you observe such a system you would know how to recreate it, and likely how to make it better. This will work on any magic that you understand, as a bonus you know how to create the intricate crystal systems that are part of the geneforge.


-Fleshcrafter (Claymore) (600CP)
        You know the processes behind the creation of Half Yoma, Abyss Feeders, and even just cobbling together flesh into a rather long lived, and hard to kill body. If it's a secret known to the organization of working flesh anything from humans to Asarakam, you know it all, and can even go beyond in time. You do at least know exactly how to ensure that every half yoma you produce is at a level near the top ranks of warriors within the organization. With a little effort you could find a way to produce them without a stigma, or create ones that don't show their nature through bleaching their body of pigment and turning their eyes silver.


-Glyph Magic (Thief) (600CP)
        You've been trained in the secret art of glyph magic. By writing it down on a surface you can activate the magic. Eventually your skill might grow to the point where you can "draw" in the air. There are Battle Glyphs that are utilized in battle, such as attacking or for defensive purposes like invisibility. Utility Glyphs allow you to augment something, such as augmenting a statue with animation, or closing another glyph. Stationary Glyphs are permanent, they allow things like locking a door, or a chair to the ground, or perhaps even opening a secret door. These are just some of the possibilities that were presented in the games, but perhaps you will find creative uses for all these glyphs. Additionally you've been granted the secrets of the transformation glyphs used for Glyph Enhanced perk, allowing you to enhance those that serve under you.


-I Am The Architect (Solo Leveling) (600CP)
        It would be an understatement to call you a genius, Jumper. Your mind is one that only has a single peer in the universe when it comes to your technological and magical knowledge. You have mastered the magics of the Monarchs and Rulers, allowing you to create pocket worlds of your own, opening portals to them, existing into another dimensional space and puppeteering powerful avatars, replicating abilities such as the Ruler's Authority with your own magic, as well the creation of such powerful puppets, capable of dealing evenly with S-Ranked dungeon bosses. Finally, your ability would allow you to replicate the feats of The Architect, creating a System for any ability of yours or others, either obtained willingly or forcibly, to train others into. As the Administrator of this System, however, you could also, at any point, seal or take the powers that you have granted access to at any point. You can combine your previous talents to create 'Quests' and 'items' that would help those 'Players' to level up and get better at using their abilities. You can only have a maximum of eight active 'Players' of this system, but you can permanently separate them from The System once they have matured enough with their powers without them losing their powers


-Magical Prodigy (Ben 10) (600CP)
        You're a wizard, Jumper You start out with enough knowledge to perform basic spells such as generating wind and track people and are generally on the same level as Charmcaster at the beginning of Ben 10. You're a magical prodigy that could one day reach the same level of power as Bezel himself if you pushed yourself hard enough, but that could take decades if not centuries of studying and practice.


-Meta Art Shenanigans (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (600CP)
        When you were small and dipped your tiny little fingers into paint, the world opened up to you enrapturing your infant mind with the things you could create. Now older, you've put your heart and soul into refining that artistic talent to the point it became a bit...mad in the process, Jumper. You can manipulate 2D and flat 3D images in impossible ways like making non-magical paintings talk, turning a picture of running shoes into actual running shoes, and if you draw a T-Rex bursting out of the wall with chalk it can attack and drag people into the wall with it, and many more strange things besides. You also have a close connection with the things you draw as well as the 2D dimension and can interact with them in strange ways. Draw a dark tunnel with an exit at the end and you can walk through it like a portal, stick your hand to a flat wall and become a 2D cartoon painting that can move and travel through deep cracks to enter rooms, even create traps just by drawing them where people will step. You can do all this and more, Jumper, so long as you have the materials or viable surfaces, as your artistic talent could make Michelangelo weep if you put enough thought into it.


-Mystcraft (Minecraft) (600CP)
        With a bit of paper, leather, and ink, you can create Linking and Descriptive Books, which allow you to travel between worlds... within some limits. No Linking Book will be able to return you to any world but your current jump, so long as your chain continues. Furthermore, without a genuine understanding of the nature of dimensions, any new world you create with a Descriptive Book will be another Minecraft-type world, cursed to Decay into nothingness over the course of a week or so. This can be a handy way to gather resources without disrupting a 'real' world, or a good place to experiment with dangerous things, but nothing more... at least for now. Be sure to keep your Linking Books handy and your Descriptive Books safe; should you lose your Linking Book, you will be trapped within a doomed world, and should the Descriptive Book that defines a world be destroyed while you are in it, you will be destroyed alongside it. Careful searching of these worlds may turn up hints of forgotten lore that you can use to improve your skills, but the rotten fragments of paper you find in these decaying libraries will raise more questions than they answer.


-Reaching Omega: Formations (Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse) (600CP)
        Something has happened to the Dao you've been cultivating Jumper, your Dao has traces of becoming an Omega one. All it would take is following your instincts to allow you to transform it into an Omega Dao. Be careful however because a Dao like this means an even harder time passing the Daomerge.
        * Formation in this setting is a means of channelling energy. It takes material and time to set up. Uses include concentrating ambient energy, defensive formations, and joining peoples magic together for more powerful attacks. A Omega dao is the highest class of dao, meaning this perk sets you on the path to becoming literally perfect with the settings version of runes.
        * Dao is essentially the laws of heavens that cultivators learn to control reality. Omega laws are essentially merging all your laws into the one law to make it supreme. It is also required for reaching the perk of cultivation. So for example a omega dao of formations would allow you to create universe and multiverses with formations.


-Real v Fake (Monogatari Series) (600CP)
        Truth, despite what you may have heard, is not a single, clear-cut and defined answer. It is malleable, changing to fit the definition of the one seeking it. Nowhere is this clearer than the debate on whether a fake thing can surpass the real thing or not. You have a certain ability based on what is real and what is fake, depending on which of the three options below you pick from. You may buy this perk multiple times, though each option is only discounted to Specialists.
        The first option is to believe that what is real will always trump what is not. You gain the ability to make any real thing automatically trump over any fake copies over that same real thing, such as making a genuine legendary sword always cut straight through any replicas made of that legendary sword, and that these real things will also possess a strong advantage against any fake thing in general, such as a genuinely made shield being much stronger against imaginary bullets or magical fire.
        The second option is to believe that there is no actual difference between a fake and the real thing. This allows you to treat good quality fake things as if they were actually the real thing, even if they don't match exactly. Those fake legendary swords, even if they are normally significantly weaker than the real deal, can instead become the real thing in full at your command.
        The final option is for you to believe that fake things can eventually surpass the real thing, if they earnestly try for such a thing. With this, you can force fake copies of things to slowly grow in power until they are twice as good as the original real thing and then improve further so long as they are constantly used. Those fake blades might not be as good as the real deal


-Reshaping (Geneforge) (600CP)
        Normally applying shaping magic to a living creature in some way other than an attempt at healing them will cause horrific and rather random results. Though much of shaping was developed by doing this, and carefully studying the results, truly modifying a living being to a great degree is impossible to control without carefully crafted essence, or incredibly complicated equipment such as the geneforge itself. You however have an innate ability to understand what you are doing and control the results.


-Ritualist (Ravenwood) (600CP)
        Ritual magic is an extensive form of arcane practice that allows those using it to accomplish great works even as fairly weak mages. You have gained considerable knowledge, both practical and theoretical, on the workings of ritual magic and, by extension, sacrificial blood magic. This allows you to create far reaching and incredibly powerful spell matrices that can be supplied over time by anyone, or fuelled by the life force of sacrificed creatures or blood. Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump.


-Soul Source (Dresden Files) (600CP)
        Somehow, you've gained the power of Soulfire; the ability to use the energies of your soul to enhance your magic. By infusing a spell with notjust your will, but all your being, it'll be infused with a sort of "mystic rebar," granting it a lot of strength and giving it significantly more structure. Since your self is part of the spell now, it also functions more along the lines of your intentions, rather than just providing you with a raw boost. Of course, this comes at a cost: you're literally burning away part of your soul for power. Souls do heal up, especially when engaged in "soul-affirming" activities, but overuse might be worse than fatal.


-Soul Study (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (600CP)
        The core of existence, at least for natural life forms. You've put countless long hours into studying that soul that lies at the centre of your being and the souls of other people as well. Slowly, you mastered this art, gaining the knowledge of how to interact with and manipulate the soul itself. You know how to physically interact with and move souls from one vessel to another, to create souls from nothing, to give physical form for souls to inhabit, to directly alter and change the soul itself and even how to bring back souls of those who have very recently passed on, saving them from death. To many, what you do is both a miracle and blasphemy, both of the highest order. To you though, it's just another science.


-Spellmaker (Morroblivion) (600CP)
        You are talented at creating new spells from trial and error. They tend to be relatively efficient in terms of magicka expenditure and can incorporate various effects. Creating new effects is time consuming but possible.


-Talisman Master (Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension) (600CP)
        While most mortals' exposure to talismans is the small, charm-like items that allow limited use of martial techniques, the Dao of Talismans is a Grand Dao which is the pinnacle of organizing and using other Daos and energy. Purchasing this perk provides you with the benefits of every specialty listed under Master Craftsman, a similar level of knowledge on the creation of the aforementioned minor talismans, mastery of the Dao Insight for Talismans, and the ability to use that Dao to control the power of all of your other Dao Insights to maximize their potential
        Master Craftsman: alchemy/pill refining, equipment refinement, formations, puppets, spirit chef
        * In this world Talismans lead to the peak of cultivation.


-Lesser Magicks (Lone Wolf) (700CP)
        These are the beginning magicks of the Shianti. Shianti Origin who select this ability can choose four skills off of this list after paying the cost of the perk. Non Shianti Origin can choose three after paying the cost. Additional skills are 100CP per skill beyond the number allotted by your Origin. Using the Moonstone will enhance the strength and utility of spells from these disciplines.
        Sorcery (100CP)
        This power allows a wizard to transform his thoughts and desires into magical energy. Focusing your energies will allow you to create magical shields or move objects.
        Enchantment (100CP)
        Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others.
        Elementalism (100CP)
        Minor control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. Using this ability requires a trance state. Also, spirits of the Elemental Plane may not understand your request and might answer your call for aid in the manner you did not intend.
        Alchemy (100CP)
        The ability to create potions and solutions to effect objects and individuals.
        Prophecy (100CP)
        Through the use of a meditative state, a wizard can foretell the future. The clarity of the foretelling is tied to the wizard's knowledge of the object or individual in question. Asking about someone or something you know will give more detail than someone or something unknown.
        Psychomancy (100CP)
        The ability to see and read the past by laying hands on an object. Results may be cryptic, and magic can be used to create intentionally misleading results.
        Evocation (100CP)
        The ability to contact the spirit realm and speak with the dead. Spirits communed with may be hostile, requiring the wizard to ward himself, and spirits will require the wizard to perform a task in exchange for any aid rendered. Failing to accomplish the agreed upon task may result in the wizard losing his life.


-Psyker (Warhammer 40k) (700CP)
        * Ability to use Psyker abilities with one specialty, includes one psy focus. You are an Alpha-level psyker.


-Magic For Dummies spec: Enchantment, Rune Carving (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (800CP)
        I see that you are interested in the next one of these. In particular, this series is quite stressful, I can either give you one that covers the basics of most magic systems or you can choose something more specialized. The more focused, the better results you will get. Don't worry about affinities either, there are some notes inside of how to work around that.


-Maker of Magic (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (800CP)
        The Sage began by learning how to Mix physical things. Then she moved onto magical things. Then she moved onto the soul itself. All of her great works paled in comparison to what she mastered and gave to the world when she first appeared to the public though. Manipulation of the Magic System itself. She turned a traditional system of magic into one like what you'd see in an MMO videogame, changing this magic over two whole worlds. Now that knowledge and ability is yours. You have the ability and knowledge to make widespread changes and alterations to magical systems with a few hours of focus and work. You could make a system based on ritual invocations and sacrifices take on the form of an RPG magic system or vice versa. You can combine systems you already have access to with new ones in however ways you like, add restrictions or even remove limitations and add new aspects, though improving the overall power would require comboing with a stronger magic system you already know. The changes you make are applied to the entirety of the subject Magic System but beings with more power than you are not required to use it, instead being able to rely on the old system if they wish. Those weaker than you are forced to follow all the new rules, unless they themselves can prevent it somehow.


-Restriction/Formation Expert | Cultivation | Formation and Restriction Flags (Renegade Immortal) (800CP)
        Restriction/Formation Expert (300CP)
        Formations and restrictions are two different yet similar methods of achieving similar results.
        Formations are ordered structures built from materials and powerful resources that can accomplish a variety of tasks, including teleportation across vast distances to pre-set destinations, creating incredibly powerful barriers to keep enemies out or allowing multiple weaker people to work together to create a far more powerful force. One of the most potent examples of formations, one that only late Second Step and Third Step cultivators would know about, is the Realm Sealing Formation, an unimaginably vast sealing formation that separates the Cave World into the Inner and Outer Realms.
        Restrictions, on the other hand, require no resources aside from knowledge and the divine sense and they can change according to the will of the user, making them much more dynamic and free-form as compared to formations. The most common use for restrictions is to boobytrap an area, filling a space with manifold restrictions that require long periods of careful study to bypass, lest you step on a blade of grass that will become a storm of blades that simultaneously sets off all the adjacent restrictions and creates a truly dangerous predicament. You have an incredible talent for your chosen discipline, as well as years of experience and a well honed sense of intuition for unknown restrictions or formations. This talent and experience has manifested in a particularly piercing gaze, allowing you see through restrictions, formations and patterns with incredible ease.
        Cultivation (0CP)
        This represents your ability to cultivate, be it your body, your soul, your spirit or stranger things. Whatever the path, you have an average talent with all of them, representing a span of physical potential, mental ability and potency of self. Your willpower is bolstered, enough that the pains and hardships everyone must face are bearable. Focusing on one thing or another for long periods of time is now easy.
        Drop-ins start at the first stage of Qi Condensation, but have no method or techniques they didn't buy here. Mortals have no cultivation and thus no method or technique, but still retain the same level of talent as the others, barring any other purchases. Young Cultivators have a method of average value, a small handful of middling techniques and a cultivation mid-way through Qi Condensation. Old Cultivators have a cultivation of early Foundation Establishment, a potent method and a collection of techniques that would make any junior envious.
        You aren't restricted in the heights your cultivation can reach, but with just this it's unlikely you'll make it far with just this.
        Once you leave this jump you will be able to give other people the ability to cultivate.
        Formation and Restriction Flags (500CP)
        This is a set of formation or restriction flags, created from a great deal of resources, that allow you to easily set up formations, or employ restrictions, on the fly. For 100 CP you receive a set of nine basic formation or restriction flags.
        The set of formation flags each have one fairly basic formation that can be set up on any location in moments, and removed just as easily. They contain basic formations such as ones that can gather enough spiritual energy from the surroundings to greatly aid the cultivation of even a Foundation Establishment cultivator, seal areas so that even peak Foundation Establishment cultivators have to go to great lengths to break into them, or link the energies of a set of people inside a certain area so that each of them is as strong as all of them put together, up to the peak of the great circle of Foundation Establishment.
        The set of restriction flags contains flags of the same strength except that these contain one restriction each. They contain basic restrictions such as ones that can launch attacks when unauthorized people trespass on certain places, restrictions that can trap locations, doors, chests or items and trigger preset effects when they are interacted with in certain manners, or even restrictions that act like spells and abilities of significant strength and can be used actively in combat.
        You can obtain either set for 100 CP and both for 200 CP. Formation Experts receive a basic set of Formation Flags for free and Restriction Experts receive a basic set of restriction flags for free. And both of them can modify and even replace the formations and restrictions in the flags.
        For an undiscounted 100 CP you can upgrade all your sets of flags. Upgraded sets have flags that can hold multiple formations or restrictions, up to nine each. The upgraded flags can hold restrictions of any level of strength and the formations or restrictions they hold to start with have increased in strength to the Core Formation level.
        * Cultivation is needed to make use for formations/restrictions


-Feel It Out | Synchronicity Event (F.E.A.R.) (900CP)
        Feel It Out (600CP)
        Your ability to understand machines and designs are more than just knowledge, and anyone who follows your work would know this well. You have a subtle psionic ability to 'understand' the machines and items that you physically touch, to the point where you can understand how it might work. More importantly, what you could do to also make it better. Naturally the more complex or esoteric the item is, the more drastically the time needed increases. But the more information you collect the more ideas and methods you can formulate to begin working.
        Synchronicity Event (300CP)
        [Requires "Feel It Out"] Curiouser and curiouser. Due to coming into contact with... well, SOMETHING, your psionic abilities have noticeably increased. Psychic powers you may have had are stronger now, with control and development coming more quickly with practice. There is also a boon to this; by taking a few days to 'attune' a person, you may impart upon them the beginning of psionic abilities of their own. You may only gift one school at a time, and they start at the very beginning; if they are to grow and learn as you have, it would be wise to teach them. On the plus side, they'll eventually become as strong as you are, so you'll have quite the pupil on your hands.


-Technomagical Genius | All Magic Affinity (In Another World With My Smartphone) (1000CP)
        Technomagical Genius (600CP)
        You are a master of both magic and technology, as well as fusing them together. Your only equal in the history of the world would be the famous Regina Babylon, the genius professor that created the flying islands of Babylon (named after herself) as well as the Frame Gears ... which are basically magi-technical giant mecha. You are her equal in these arts and crafts in every regard, your only limitation being access to resources and personal magical ability if you don't have All Magic Affinity. You can even make gynoids and transfer the consciousness of a person into said gynoid if you felt like it.
        All Magic Affinity (400CP)
        Like what it implies, you have an Affinity with all types of magic, including all types of Null magic. This means that you have the (possibly unique) ability to use all types of magic in the world, needing only to know the chant needed to activate it and a general idea of what the magic is supposed to do. For example by knowing that the Gate spell requires the chant of gate and that it is a spell that opens a portal to a place you have already been you would be capable of casting that spell. You carry this ability to quickly learn and master all forms of magic to future worlds and systems.


-Mantra Generation | Guide of Naraka | Demigod | Mantra Affinity | A Tangled Web Weaved | Mantra Training and Techniques | Cyborg Hindu Godbody (Asura's Wrath) (1100CP)
        Mantra Generation (0CP)
        A being with a soul (you do have a soul, right?) can generate Mantra by prayer or feeling emotion. This mantra can be utilized by devices powered by Mantra Technology, or the Demigods of Shinkoku Trastrium.
        Guide of Naraka (100CP)
        You gain a secondary form that of a golden spider. You gain the ability to visit Naraka, the space between the living world and the engine of reincarnation, dangling from a single spool of divine spider silk. When inside Naraka, you may manipulate souls who are attempting to climb the infinite towers and return to their lives, rendering them your catspaws. Finally, when in this state your voice takes on an eerie intonation that subliminally influences a subject's emotional state. The spiderform also helps you think up armor piercing questions and baffling Koans.
        You cannot spend more than 24 hours in Naraka. If you do, you must climb out as described in Tower of Naraka.
        Demigod (100CP)
        You are one of the elite masters of Mantra, equivalent to the Eight Guardian Generals/Seven Divinities in power if not actual rank. You have access to the most extensive theotechonological advancements and training techniques. Mantra Levels: Your maximum Mantra Level is what you can safely wield before damaging yourself. If more Mantra is focused your way, you run the risk of exploding, or turning into a planet powered rage monster. Neither of these outcome are guaranteed, of course. Your Maximum Mantra Level begins at 0 before any perks.
        Mantra Affinity (100CP)
        You are empowered by a single flavor of sentient emotion. When acting within the themes of your dominant Mantra, you are capable of peak human feats. You count as both a prayer source and an emotional source of Mantra. There are eight Mantra affinities, Wrath, Violence, Vanity, Sloth, Melancholy, Lust, Greed, and Pride. Without a Mantra Affinity, you are denied the strength of emotion, and must subsist on ordinary Mantra. By taking this perk, your safe Mantra Level is set to 2, and you always count as having a minimum of Mantral Level 1 for purposes of determining such feats.
        A Tangled Web Weaved (200CP)
        You gain a true god's understanding of Mantra's fundamental nature. Strangely, it seems to resemble a spider's web, and you are able to manipulate it into a batch of silken threads. You may spin silk in your spider form, or from your hands. It can be anchored to air itself, and are made of glittering golden Mantra. The strands are nigh unbreakable save by superhuman effort. With skill, care and practice over centuries, perhaps it can be manipulated to more complex tasks than mere ensnarement...
        Mantra Training and Techniques (200CP)
        You have learned or been taught numerous techniques to focus and express your Mantra, rendered as supernatural martial arts and superhuman feats of agility, durability and so on. Meditative Kata can extend your natural lifespan, heal minor wounds and fight off sickness, while strikes and attacks could shatter walls. This increases your maximum Mantra level by 1.
        As an added benefit, this perk also allows you to create your own personal Mantra Form. Your first form will take approximately five years of study and meditation to fully construct, but when completed, you will be able to manifest an external mantra interface. To most people, it will look like an ornate halo, evocative of your personality and mantra affinity.
        A Mantra Form usually has a core theme, such as improved combat ability, damage resistance, speed or other such boosts. Establishing a form enhances your abilities, even beyond what a given level of Mantra would normally allow. With a mantra form active, you may easily perform superhuman physical, mental and social feats, even before the direct application of Mantra. These stances and techniques however cannot enhance stranger powers such as psychic blasts or arcane magic, short of ensuring you can survive to perform them.
        Successfully creating an initial form and manifesting it increases your capacity for Mantra by 1.
        Subsequent forms and other perks can increase this cap further, to a maximum of 8. You may use any mantra form you know, but you cannot stack them. Creating a new form takes ten years, times the number of forms you have already mastered.
        Your halos can be attacked however, and if knocked aside or even destroyed. If that happens, you immediately drop down to Mantra Level 3, and any excess Mantra is wasted.
        Cyborg Hindu Godbody (400CP)
        You have a genetically, cybernetically and magically enhanced physiology, and the knowledge to propagate this technology. Your capacity to wield Mantra is enhanced, both accepting general Mantra as well as your primary association.
        This constructed body can heal itself, or be repaired by yourself or others. Your magical physiology is obvious, but always aesthetically pleasing. You can survive in space without a suit, endure planet busting attacks with sufficient Mantra, and are otherwise ageless. This increases your maximum Mantra Level by 2.




-Facets of Sockets | Chromafactor (Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath) (1200CP)
        Facets of Sockets (600CP)
        Gems are both a way of effecting the world and a stable source of power, but they don't actually do anything unless directed. Sockets are the mounting points for gems, and they define how the gem's power is expressed in the world. They don't provide any power, but they provide a path for existing power to flow along in order to achieve specific results. This perk makes you an expert at the types of sockets in the gemcraft world, and also allows you to come up with novel designs in the future. All gemcrafters know how to create Towers, Gem-Traps, Lanterns, Amplifiers, and Pylons, but you can make more efficient versions of them that syphon off some of a gem's spare power to reinforce themselves. Oh, and we'll even toss in Magical Walls for free. Be aware that these structures are made of solidified mana and thus the more of them you have linked to your Orb of Presence (or around your personal fortress) the more building a new one will cost.
        Chromafactor (600CP)
        Different wizards use different colors of gems to enact different effects. This perk allows you to create new gem colors based on any magic that you understand at a fundamental level. The gems can then be used as inflexible but incredibly potent foci for those effects. If a normal sleep spell could cause a strong foe to become drowsy, the applications of a gem that can send entire armies into eternal slumber are hopefully obvious. This also acts as a capstone booster, providing additional benefits from each origin's capstone perk


-Keeper: Forger of Giants: Enchanted (Azeroth) (1500CP)
        Forger of Giants: Your talents of craft extend to the direct creation and modification of living beings. You have the ability to craft life itself. While you cannot make life from nothing, you can harness any source of life or spirit to create a soul for a living being. Without a source you may still make complicated facsimiles of life similar to A.I. and or elementals. You may forge, re-forge, temper, purify, and heal any kind of mind, spirit, body, or soul cleaning it of corruption, deterioration, disease, tarnish, blemish or error, strengthening it against harm or others interference. While you do have the ability to do the same to even yourself, it will take a great deal of time or power, as you were crafted by the titans themselves and already tempered to such an extent to be able to wage war against the corrupting and chaotic forces of the old gods and elementals. Your ability to craft and uplift bodies and souls allows you to create races up to a similar power and form as the Mogu, Tol'vir, Iron Vrykul, Earthen, and Giants. You have the ability to resurrect any being weaker than yourself into its original body or into a new body up to a form you could create, as long as a beings, mind, spirit, soul hasn't been captured or restrained you can resurrect it freely, even if its essence is being restrained. You have the ability to transition between the realms of the living and the dead, attack incorporeal beings with physical matter and even if a soul is destroyed as long as you can find even a fragment of it or the being that destroyed it you can use the fragment or shatter the destroyers soul to re-forge the original soul, you may need a source of life or spirit to rebuild it as if creating a new soul from scratch.
        You May Choose: Priest
        Enhanced: Given the same amount of time and effort you could create beings on par with the titanic-watchers themselves, elevate the proto-dragons into full dragons, or raise the dead as Val'kyr. But now given enough time those are not limitations to what you can create, given enough time to forge and craft you could create a being to rival anything, old god, naaru, dragon aspect there is no limit as long as you have the time to forge strengthen and imbue more energy or craft with better materials. The stronger and more skilled you grow the faster this process becomes. The life you create can be given extraordinary abilities to travel between the realms of the living and dead or the dream interacting with such realms with ease. You could craft intangible or incorporeal bodies, or forms made of living lighting. Even without access to spirit you could craft a soul from any of the primal forces creating an arcane soul or a soul of light, while they fundamentally work differently and some scholars may argue with you it is life. Anything you craft will be unfalteringly loyal to you, obeying any order or command you have never trying to betray you. While this is happily and willingly desired by things you create from scratch or imbue with its first wil., the resurrected may only be begrudgingly held to this standard. This specialty applies to anything you can create not just life. No sword you forged could ever harm you unless you wanted it to and if it was a living weapon it may even slice it own wielders throat if they tried to use it against you. You may put limitations on wielders like Odin did with Mjolnir. You are now a font of Light, you may wield and imbue light into all your magic and crafts, while not infinite or even at the level of a Na'ru the light in you will continue to grow and will eventually allow for true light forging.
        You May Choose: Paladin


-Keeper: Shaper of Worlds: Enchanted (Azeroth) (1500CP)
        Shaper of Worlds: Your skills in the crafting of objects, buildings, and landscapes grants you the ability to forge artifacts and legendary equipment with ease, your crafting capabilities being an order of magnitude greater than they would have been without this focus. You have the ability to craft landscapes, you can easily shape mountains, valleys, rivers and seas to your liking in minutes enriching the earth and sky with magic to amplify and encourage or discourage the flourishing of life or specific species. Everything you build is a masterful work of art, both beautiful and functional beyond compare. The things you create being sturdier and nearly indestructible fighting off the weathering of time and the environment even without the use of magic, a painting you made could be lost in an acid swamp for millennia and barely need a light dusting and drying to make it presentable. You also have an intuitive sense of any crafts you come across instinctively knowing what it once was no matter how rundown it is, even a small shred of a few strands of a quilt would do, having visions of and knowing its full purpose, intent, and how it was used; you have the ability to understand the original creators design and how to improve it both functionally and artistically. Anything you restore qualifies as being crafted by you for the purposes of any effects you have, including your preservation skills and quality skills. Anything you are actively crafting, have crafted, or in charge of can be preserved by your will and an occasional thought, this being an active force protected against harm, decay and entropy. Only beings who directly intend to harm you or the things you have crafted or preserved can hope to damage them and even still such damage is lessened, and you will be able to restore such things later. You may repair and restore things to exactly as they were or an improved state up to your level of crafting; your powers of preservation and restoration can apply to non-crafted things that you watch over such as the environment, climate, weather, and enchantments.
        You May Choose: Hunter
        Enhanced: You may now craft impossibilities into your lands, cut a mountain or raise a continent into the sky where it will stay, imbue the land with the ability to fight back and defend itself against invaders, build world machines and city forges to aid in the creation of anything you can imagine. Your crafts are as immortal and timeless as yourself, nearly impervious to outside forces. You can build temples to enhance the gather of worship and various types of energy, forge and craft mega structures like sky elevators and dyson spheres, even artificial suns and black holes are within your grasp as long as you have the materials and magics. The prisons you build could trap old gods, multidimensional beings, eldrazi, or the like forever this extends to the point of beings that aren't just stronger than you but god like in their strength to you. You could build a tomb to imprison Sargeras till the end of time long after the heat death of the universe and your prison will still stand. Whatever you build will function as intended no matter how impractical the design is. This comes with the added ability of being able to force higher dimensional beings or entities from other realms into whatever realm you are crafting in. That ghost who can phase through solid objects can't phase through your bricks, or fist, unless you allow it. This comes with more esoteric capabilities like building rivers out of fire, mountains out of smoke, a living tree out of feathers and glass that is still capable of photosynthesis. Your alchemical capabilities are to the point you can not only transmute metals to stone, or vise versa, you could transmute things into organic materials of your liking or something between organic, inorganic, energy, and dreams. You are now a font, well, and battery of Arcane. Short of the titans themselves you are the strongest source of arcane energy. Arcane energy flows from you with ease allowing you to supply this power to whatever you like.
        You May choose: Monk


-Keeper: Weaver of Dreams: Enchanted (Azeroth) (1500CP)
        The titanic-watchers, first of the titan-forged, their bodies were hand crafted by the Pantheon from the material surface of Azeroth before being brought to life by a great infusion of arcane and spirit. Designed to act as a medium between the Pantheon and Azeroth, flesh from one, mind and soul from the other. Traits - All titanic-watchers are immensely powerful beings, expert craftsmen, and masterful warriors wielding magics and skills for the purpose of destroying the old gods, taming the elementals, and ordering worlds from chaos. You must choose whether you are of the stone crafted Vanir or the metal crafted Aesir. The Vanir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from stone with command over the powers of the earth and fire. The Aesir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from metal with command over the powers of storms, wind, and lightning. While all titanic-watchers are already more skilled than even the greatest of mortals dare to dream, all titanic-watchers have specialties. You may choose Warrior or Mage as a class, and you choose one of the following specialties:
        Weaver of Dreams: You have the ability to design new spells from scratch if need be, but you have an intrinsic understanding of all forms of magic or spells you come across. While you might not have enough power to actually wield those forces you will absolutely understand them. But what good is knowledge if you can't do anything with it? You laugh at such notions as you can always find a way to improve any magic, making any given spell, enchantment, or ritual more versatility, faster to cast, faster to recover, require less mana or resources, stronger, and increasing the duration; basically, any means by which a spell or enchantment could be improved is improved by double or half as appropriate. But you do not simply cast spells, you craft magic itself, from arcane sources, wielding forces beyond compare, making new spells, enchantments, and rituals as needed. Even on the fly, with comparative capabilities of other magics within that area, your improvisational magic is inspired and artistic in the extreme allowing you to incorporate any kinds of themes for your magics or supernatural abilities. As you are wielding the raw craft of the arcane itself, your spells cannot be countered unless the counter would negate magic itself (a counter fireball or counter any fire magic spell would not work against your fireball, they would have to have a counter for any magic spell, anti-magic effect.) Your magic is more resilient and more easily bypasses defenses, your enchantments take on a life of their own as you are able to weave enchantments into intrinsic natures to create wonders of spell craft such as true alchemy creating new substances, pocket dimensions, magical terrains and sacred places on the order of mythals, legendary spells, and magical items akin to artifacts, and mythical charms. Your magical strength and reserves are increased by an order of magnitude , and this specialty implies to any kinds of magic or similar supernatural abilities you have such as divinity or psionics.
        You May Choose: Druid
        Enhanced: You can weave magic into intricate reality so as to define the laws and natures of the world it's in and create spaces, realms, and dimensions that overlap with each other. With enough arcane energy magic can even be used to create realities and dreams that are interchangeable making something real into a dream or something that was once a dream into real thereby granting you the ability to craft matter and dreams themselves. Creating something like the Emerald Dream, for the dreams of life and world, or even the shadowlands, for the souls of the dead, would be easy for someone like you, if not time consuming, It took Freya a few thousand years to complete the emerald dream, which still required regular maintenance, preservation, and protection. Not only are you able to create new realms, you can freely travel worlds and sub-planes such as the old planes of the dream or the emerald nightmare. You can build gates to other worlds and planes or simply travel there directly, you can enter the spaces between spaces or even make them yourself. You have an intrinsic understanding of your place in the world and where to find things, lost or known, physical, ephemeral, or even knowledge. You are never lost, can easily find your way home or through any maze or labyrinth uncover all its secrets like child's play. And if someone ever does try to trap or endanger you you may simply step back into one of the realms you've made from anywhere. You have also become a font, or well, and battery of Life and spirit able to wield not only arcane magics, but druidic and shamanic ones as well, imbuing it into your craft. Your spirit energy and life force will continue to grow, which can be enhanced by proper usage of your realms and enchantments.
        You May Choose: Shaman
        While your abilities and skills are far more vast, varied, and greater than any other races, besides your makers, your power is not. You are stronger than any normal dragon, but the dragon aspects outclass you, it would take dozens of you to kill an elemental lord, and a small army of you may not succeed in defeating an old god let alone killing one. However, for an additional 500 cp you will be a Keeper, personally chosen out of the army of titanic-watchers, imbued with strength beyond compare. Your power is so great that many of the lesser races worship you as a god. Two Keepers working together could kill an elemental lord with relative ease, and a keeper with a small squadron of titanic-watchers could defeat and capture an old god. You may choose one of the following: You gain a second specialization blending them so that both specialization's traits apply to all aspects of the other specialization , or you may gain an unmatched level of combat experience removing the restrictions on your class - any class or profession you gain you become the paragon of that class outmatching anyone with that same class as you to the point of being able to hit one level above your weight/power class with ease you can pick one extra class for free. Either way the strength of all your specializations are doubled and you gain Enhanced capabilities with them. You will be a leader and a tactician capable of organizing thousands upon thousands of people with ease to accomplish specific goals such as war, combating poverty, or finding a cure for a disease. People will be more likely to help you than not, even if they have nothing in particular to gain. Any companions, followers, friends, organizations, and family you had before find their loyalty towards you increased. Things that are a direct benefit to you are guaranteed to have any organizations you control work their hardest to see you succeed.




 --- Domain: Crafting: Artisan (26) (50 Perks) --- 




-Artisan (Generic Builder) (100CP)
        You have a talent for creating works of art. Creation times are halved and your natural talent increases with each purchase of this knack. Your artwork has an almost magical ability to invoke a particular emotion that you set at the time of its creation, scary masks, awe inspiring fountains, creepy puppets or such. The degree of emotion-induction effect increases with skill.
        * Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers


-Crafting Artisan (World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen) (100CP)
        When it comes to the manufacturing of physical goods, such as blacksmithing, woodworking, basket weaving, etc, you are an expert in dozens of fields. More than that, you have a certain artistic flare to your work that others can't help but notice.


-Craftsman (Generic Builder) (100CP)
        You have a talent for creating things requiring wood as well as selecting the best wood for the job at hand. Creation times are halved for each purchase of this knack and the results are always visually impressive if you so wish.
        * Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers


-Family Jewels (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        You're a certified jeweler, well versed in things like stone cutting, gem polishing, and working with precious metals like copper and gold in a non-martial sense. You can deftly handle any metal up to Rank III (silver) and your knowledge of gemology and the symbolic nature of precious stones could earn you critical acclaim if you continue to hone your skills.


-Guest Artist (Medaka Box Abnormal) (100CP)
        All the kids have their own style these days. A new way of being drawn, a new way of speaking, something to really make them stand out from all the other Jump characters. You can sell out and join the trend now too! You're able to freely change your art style and speech font to whatever you want, even basing it on some of the classic artist's work of the past. Of course, given how these things are usually designed to be in a manga, appearing very different visually may terrify those around you and different word fonts may make you sound very strange. But isn't it worth it when it makes you stand out to your readers?


-Lunatic Trickster (Van Helsing) (100CP)
        You will have peasantry frequently knocking at your door with their torches and pitchforks, adventurers dashing through your laboratories, and your creations frequently trying to escape. Now you can prevent all of this from happening with your knowledge of creating fiendish, murderous traps of all damage ranges & variants! Those not entirely dependent on the environment, such as pitfall traps, can be stored in small silver discs to be used as weapons.


-Savant (Generic Exalted) (100CP)
        You're a Savant! This means you've got an incredible insight in crafting all sorts of things, from meals, to clothes, to armor, to weapons, to magical devices, and all sorts of other things besides. Even if you've never done something before so long as it's a skill remotely 'craft like' in nature you'll be able to perform it at the level of a (mortal) master. This just represents innate talent, and if you actually focus on developing such skills the normal way you'll quickly outstrip even the best that a mortal craftsman could accomplish, able to make artwork that speaks to the soul (perhaps literally) or armor and weapons of surpassing quality that look like show-room pieces despite being suitable for combat and also being sturdy and reliable to a frankly unbelievable degree. Purchasing this will even make you substantially better than other Exalted craftsmen, assuming you put in the same amount of effort that they did.


-Shaper (Age Of Wonders II) (100CP)
        Stone is a tough servant, resisting most ways to work it by unskilled hands. Under your touch, however, it molds itself eagerly, as if it were unable to wait to become the new shapes you wish for it. You are a gifted artisan with the natural materials of the world, and can build fortifications, buildings, and other creations out of wood, stone, sand, and any other such materials with great ease. Indeed, under your touch the materials you work with seem to become greater, somehow - sand and clay toughen to match granite when building a wall, and a carved wooden blade seems to hold its edge like fine steel once you're finished with it.


-Architectural Madness (Exalted - The Infernal) (200CP)
        Malfean architecture is unlike anything found in Creation, with endless variety and many oddities. Many techniques that were once burned away by She Who Lives in Her Name have been rediscovered. Foremost in these are the techniques to allow demons to build structures that do not need pillars, arches and other support structures. Buildings hundreds if not thousands of feet high can be built without any apparent load-bearing walls or struts. Windows and doors can be placed anywhere without disrupting the integrity of a building.
        Of course these techniques work best with the brass and black stone common to Malfeas, even if they work to a lesser extent with other materials. So it is just one more reason most buildings in Malfeas are made of brass and basalt, along with their abundant presence. Yet many more techniques are used by the artisans and architects of Malfeas, even aside from the omnipresent murals, wall carvings, and other ornamentations.
        Techniques to create such marvels as buildings that sprout from the ground at unnatural angles and made of polished brass turned a rainbow of colors by a process known only to the most skilled of architects. In many of these techniques you have gained the pinnacle of skill and knowledge, that you might replicate the Demon City's constructions even in other realms. While you might not have reliable access to the materials common to those in hell, you will be able to substitute many other materials for these in your structures. And as a truly talented architect you will find the design and construction of Manses comes just as easily to you, even gleaning some additional power from the conflux of essence it is build upon if you do use these hellish methods.


-Deku Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        The Deku are a simple race, but they can still make some fancy items, and now you can too. From well-crafted wooden items, to a large leafy-fan that can manipulate the winds, to a special Deku Copter that can allow for flight, anything made by the Deku can be made by you as well. As a bonus, this skill also translates to an improved skill in shaping trees into houses or other structures, if you so desire.


-Gerudo Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You are a Gerudo Craftswoman, with all the skill that implies. You can make clothing for both voe and vai that can keep them cool and even help protect from lightning, fashion gorgeous swords and shields designed to be used by the greatest warriors, and Shock Arrows that encapsulate the fury of the storm itself, releasing a mighty shockwave on impact. Any item made by Gerudo hands can be shaped by yours, so long as you have gathered all needed ingredients.


-If You Want It Done Right (Lords Of The Night-Liches) (200CP)
        There's people who leech off of other people's efforts. Herd animals, herbivores the kind of weaklings who fall in line. You aren't one of them. You know the only person whose work you can really trust. A big project can be hard to tackle by yourself. Different resources, different specialities. Even if you know all the different pieces, you might not know how to put all of them together. Even if you know how to put them together, changing tracks and approaches all the time can scuttle your work. There are many extra problems that arise when you go alone, and many problems that are solved simply by having a second pair of hands helping you. None of that applies to you. Unless a problem literally requires a second pair of hands or other such gross physical assets, the work doesn't grow harder for you, simply because you have to do it all yourself. This doesn't make it easier either - if a project requires a thousand man hours of work, then you'll need to put that in. But the lack of help won't make it worse or harder. You can simply do things by yourself, provided you put in the work and the time. And for a lich, whom has all the time in the world? Well, nothing more needs to be said, does it?


-Master of the Craft (Generic Zombie Apocalypse) (200CP)
        Why settle for just being great at one type of skilled work? You are THE master of a mundane craft of your choice (something like Locksmithing, Stonemasonry, or Glassmaking). As a true master craftsman you're sure to impress with your work.


-No Escape (World of Darkness - Mortal) (200CP)
        The isolated, inescapable killing den is a trope of the slasher story, and it's a trope that has more basis in fact than fiction. Many slashers take some isolated space as their lair, fortifying it and riddling it with trap doors, secret hiding places, and most especially reinforced exits to trap their victims inside.
        For some, it's an apparently ramshackle old house on a deserted lane, the windows all boarded over and the doors nailed shut. For others it's a disused factory in the industrial district, refitted with the latest steel security doors and electronic locks.
        Whatever form it takes, it serves one purpose: trammelling some unfortunate quarry into a confined space from which there is no escape. This Perk represents the ability and skill to construct a proper murder-castle.
        Utilizing this perk allows a Slasher to construct buildings and architecture with inbuilt and near invisible traps that serve to maim and prevent escape. Any normal living space can be converted to a deadly death maze with only a few weeks work. But when an individual with this perk constructs a new structure with the intention of making it into such a place of murder, this ability truly shines. Such a building is an impossibly deadly and nearly impossible to escape structure that would confuse even the most intelligent and crafty individuals. Go ahead and re-create H.H. Holmes's boarding house with this if you want.


-Rito Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You have the ability of a Rito Craftsman. You are able to craft warm clothing that can help keep out the chill, even when soaring at the highest heights, powerful bows that can be used to fire multiple arrows at once, Fire Arrows which are enhanced with mighty winds to fan their flames hotter and create mightier updrafts, and more. Anything that has been built by a Rito can be recreated by you, given the right resources.


-Shopping list (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (200CP)
        Mixing for years and years, constantly keeping on the lookout for the next big ingredient to make something really impressive and attention gathering, you've memorised countless recipes already. In fact, you seem to even remember some recipes you're sure you never studied before. Just seeing something is enough for you to understand its recipe. You know the component pieces of whatever you're looking at, though you may not necessarily understand or know what those component pieces are, you will know what the components have as components and so on. You're also aware of what any of the component pieces you have seen can be combined to make, meaning that seeing more things will not only tell you how those things are made but also how to make even more things on top.


-Crafting (Divinity - Original Sin) (300CP)
        Crafting is a wide skill that covers everything from simple cooking all the way to magical arrowheads and amulets. Despite this, it is not precisely a trade all on its own. It represents the bits and pieces of useful item creation that some adventurers pick up by dabbling in all the trades at once. You won't be master chef or an expert enchanter, but you don't really have to be either to create something useful.
        Novice (100CP) - By studying with a variety of craftsmen for a few weeks at a time, either due to an inability to focus or a desire to obtain a general knowledge base, you've cobbled together your own set of skills and have figured out how to combine items in odd ways. Sewing taught you how to make a doll, while alchemy allowed you to grind down a certain plant into magical dust. You by combining the two, you can create a Voodoo Doll that causes pain to the one you throw it at. This is, of course, just one example of what you might be able to come up with.
        Adept (300CP) - With experience comes a certain, subtle awareness that there are more ways to use your talents than you have been up until now. Tossing an oil filled bottle with a flaming rag on top might be enough to get the job done, but there are certainly better ways to go about it. Perhaps if you slipped an Essence of Fire into the mix. Or perhaps nails! Or both! You'll find that you can not only spot new combinations of items you would not have expected but that your creativity in general has received a substantial boost.
        * It is impossible for me to fit everything you can possibly make with Crafting into any kind of sensible, readable form. It could very well be its own supplement. So have a link instead. http://www.seth-dehaan.com/divinity_crafting/
        * a. Novice Crafting allows you to make anything listed at Rank 0, 1, or 2 Crafting.
        * b. Adept Crafting allows you to make anything listed at Rank 3, 4, or 5 Crafting.
        * c. These are just examples of what you could make. Feel free to experiment.


-Crafting Genius (Final Fantasy XI) (300CP)
        You are adept with using the synthesis system to create any items or consumables which adventurers use on a regular basis, such as armor and potions. To a lesser extent, this also makes you a jack of all trades when it comes to mundane means of crafting similar items. Your work tends to be of high quality relative to the rest of the setting.


-Craftsman (Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North) (300CP)
        You have been educated in the working of metal, stone, and other materials used by Men in their arts. You can fashion swords and armor of good quality, repair your existing armor, design a building or plan the sewage system for a city. Sketch out and lead the construction of defensive walls, or some great palace fit for a mighty king. You could start with naught but the clothes on your back and in a few years be working for a king, or even build a city of your own, as your variety of skills and quality of craftsmanship will draw apprentices to you like moths to flame.


-Craftsman (Renegade Immortal) (300CP)
        Building and crafting things is an omnipresent facet of civilization. Utensils, furniture, homes and everything else, they all need people to build them. It's the same for cultivators, though the sheer length of time they live tends to mean that everyone picks up some skills here and there. When they actually devote time and effort towards mastering crafting though? The results are beyond belief.
        For 100CP, you have the talent and skill of a mortal master in an area of your choosing, such as smithing, carving, painting, sculpting or similar things. The things you can create with this skill are beautiful and functional enough to draw admiration from mortal emperors and kings. Mortals receive a free purchase of this perk.
        For 200CP, you have transcended the realm of mortal talent in all areas of craft and can sculpt statues so accurate to the real thing that they possess a shadow of the aura produced by the real thing and paintings so evocative that they can drive a man to tears or uplift him for the rest of his life. Beautiful weapons that never dull and do far more damage than they should and treasures that would be the envy of any lower realm cultivator. Mortals can buy this level for 100CP.
        For 300CP, you have the sheer level of talent and vision necessary to match, and eventually outclass Esteemed Tian Bao, the most famed craftsman of the collapsed Celestial Realm from ages gone by who was responsible for the God Slaying Chariot, an attempt to create a peerless weapon that was surprisingly successful in the end. While you're not there yet, with time, experimentation and the right materials, you could create similarly powerful treasures, artifacts or pieces of art, things that would attract the attention of Third Step cultivators. Mortals can buy this level for 200CP.


-Creating Prisons (Irredeemable/Incorruptable) (300CP)
        You are a master of the art of crafting prisons. While limited by your means your imagination has no such restraint. Whether crude prisons where your prisoners are kept in place through brutality or a Super-Max with gravity generation comparable to half that of a black hole available on demand or magnificent stellar prisons (or asylums if you wish) with the facility hidden within a star. All of these and more you find easy to come up with the initial idea, design and build with minimal testing and great speed while still building a reliable sturdy and enduring structure. Your prisons will be by default extraordinarily secure unless you undermine that for whatever reason.


-Shop Owner (ARIA) (300CP)
        Aqua isn't all about the Undine you know, and having merchants around is important to keep things running smoothly, especially on a planet like Aqua, where the majority of society has chosen a more traditional lifestyle in contrast to those who reside on Manhome. As a shop owner, you'll have your own shop of course for the duration of your stay here, which will be regularly stocked with a variety of goods. If you choose a specialized craft like bread making, wine fermenting, glass blowing, or so forth, you'll also develop a strong proficiency in this field something that you can teach to others. Naturally as a shop owner, your abilities to interact with others and develop relationships with them improves can't really be successful without that now, can you?


-Soft Physics (Generic Builder) (300CP)
        You have a touch of madness in your soul, your creations often make physics cry. Or maybe you're some sort of comic book style super-genius, with a device or invention for seemingly every occasion? Regardless, the things you make have a lot more leeway in just what they can do, thanks to not necessarily needing to obey silly things like 'physical laws', 'thermodynamics', or similar. As with all Builder related powers just how far you can stretch this depends mostly on how skilled you are and how long you've been developing your abilities.


-Workshop Artisan (Bloodborne) (300CP)
        As if taught at the long gone workshop, you seem to possess knowledge and skill with many of their crafting techniques. You have been granted the knowledge and skills needed to both repair and even create your own Trick Weapons and Hunter's Tools.
        Trick Weapons are weapons with a variety of special abilities relating to their form. The most common type of Trick Weapons are those that can transform in some manner. An example being swords that can lock into specialized sheaths in order to become different weapons, sometimes radically so. Not to say transformation is the only ability, there are also melee weapons with guns attached, and maces that can be charged with unnatural blue electricity to deal massive damage.
        Hunter's Tools are pieces of equipment with special abilities activated by using Blood Bullets or Quicksilver Bullets as a medium. Hunter's Tools are usually supernatural items that have been made to work using a Blood/Quicksilver Bullet medium, such as the Beast Roar, a beast's claw that when activated, allows the wielder to roar like a beast.
        Some Hunter's Tools are completely man made as well, though this is a relative minority. Basically, you now know how to convert things into being activated and powered by Blood Bullets and Quicksilver Bullets. Doing so allows anyone to use them, even if they are completely mundane beings, so long as they have the bullets mentioned above on their person. When making Hunter's Tools, remember that the more power something requires, the bullets the wielder will need. These skills granted to you may be honed over time, just as any other skill can.


-Core Tuning (MOUSEHUNT) (400CP)
        When hunters were focused on tackling the mouse problem around Gnawnia, there wasn't much of a need for trap variety. The mice around Gnawnia are simple critters, and even a simple mallet trap would work against them. But then the problem was suppressed, and hunters began moving to different regions. This led to them encountering mice for which the traditional mousetrap was utterly ineffective, marking the beginning of an arms race with no apparent end.
        Whether you're working on a project for a friend or for personal use, this allows you to modify a very specific property, the power type. Seen as an elemental affinity of sorts, this property is key to making tools effective under a wide range of circumstances. The traditional Physical trap doesn't do all that well against ghostly entities, but Shadow traps tend to work well. Arcane traps excel against magical entities, but certain mice are too strategically minded that they specifically require Tactical traps in order to be bested.
        There are nine different power types which can be cycled through. Physical, Tactical, Shadow, Arcane, Hydro, Forgotten, Draconic, Parental, Law and Rift. Most of these are rather straightforward except for the extremely esoteric ones like Forgotten (intended for eldritch entities...like the Old One Mice), Law (intended for criminals and outlaws) and Parental (intended for effectively anything that isn't an adult). It's important to note that this modification is more akin to an addition rather than a replacement. Existing elemental affinities on the target item are unaffected by this. You could take what is potentially a Physical Trap and give it Arcane properties.


-Crafting: Cooking, Handicrafting (Aion SB) (400CP)
        You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. For an included upcharge, Your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting.


-Heavenly Artificer Understanding (Exalted - The Sidereals) (400CP)
        The archives of Heaven still record the hidden lore of the First Age, which once raised magitech cities across Creation. You have studied all these under the tutelage of maker-gods of each mortal craft. This has made you a master of creating everything from swords to bridges to liquors to poems. You will also experience certain inspirations, strange moods that will guide you to make some specific object. If you do create it, you will eventually find yourself in a situation where it was exactly what you needed.


-Mad Science (Generic Wretched Hive) (400CP)
        You have a very particular obsession, and are very good at adapting other devices and discoveries to fit your theme. Things like bombs, guns, vat-grown monsters, mutation-inducing formula...anything suitably diabolical is a valid choice. Translating 20th-century tech into your chosen field and bringing it up to comic-book levels is child's play. Acid grenades? Guns that shoot swords? Thermite bullets? Subliminal messages that make people fly into a violent rage? Any of those can be done with a decent lab and an afternoon's work. More advanced science will take far more effort to integrate, should you get ahold of some more exotic materials.


-Mythic (Irish Mythology) (400CP)
        Whether you call them gods or fairies, the Children of Danu are just so much more, in many ways. They drink more, eat more, laugh more, love more. This perk brings a similar sense of epicness to your life, improving to at least some degree all other perks as you fight harder, sing better, see deeper and craft better items.
        More, it adds some more... abstract qualities. An ordinary warrior cannot batter a howling storm into submission, or punch someone so hard cows give virgin birth hundreds of miles away. But with this perk, you can. A humble smith cannot make a bow from the rainbow or catch a maiden's sigh and sharpen it to literally cut to a man's heart. With this, you can. It's a new and altogether more legendary way of seeing and interacting with the world.


-Swordsmith (Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (400CP)
        What else shows the spirit of the Japanese but the famed katana blade? Such a central part of their mythos as to have the most famous craftsmen become like heroes themselves. No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade. Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword.


-The Legendary God-forging Craftsman (Against The Gods!) (400CP)
        There are a lot of things in this world that go beyond martial cultivation and powering up. Sound Transmission Talismans, Profound Arks, armors and weapons, medicinal pills and teleportation formations, and so much more. And you can shake the world in all these fields. You are now an absolute, unbelievable genius at all such 'support' fields. An enchanter, smith, alchemist and formation designer without peer, your mind miles ahead of even the greatest of your would-be competitors, and ideas flow like water. You only need to look at any item, pill, weapon or formation, to know it to the innermost depths, every trick involved in making it, every flaw and potential for improvement, and how to bring them to reality. In future worlds too, your skills translate perfectly, granting you knowledge and skills in the local variations of these things equal to what you leave the previous world with.


-Anartist (SCP Foundation) (600CP)
        No, not, "an artist," an anartist, or, "anomalous artist," is someone that, through a variety of means, can create anomalies, typically as a form of artistic expression. Music, sculpture, painting, these and more are ways to create anomalous objects, including sentient or even sapient objects. You need not be an artist to be an anartist; you could simply be someone like Doctor Wondertainment who makes anomalous objects. Speaking practically, you're only able to make Safe- or Euclid-class objects, however, and all objects are likely to have some form of side-effect; the stronger the object, the more likely it is for that side-effect to be potentially deleterious, unless extreme care and counter-measures are taken, especially if it's very quickly put together. Expect objects that are completely clear of side-effects to take around ten times as long as normal to complete, compared to things that have a normal, if somewhat cumbersome, side-effect. It's assumed that most people that make incredibly powerful anomalies die in the process, at some point. These anomalies can take any form, though it's best if their form follows their function.


-Break The Door, Wrench The Lock, Smash The Door-Posts, Force The Doors (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (600CP)
        The thing about necromancy, that you've come to understand, is that it's a door. A door leading to more necromancy, and it's increasingly horrible revelations all the way down that recursive road. You can start it off. Perform an act of necromancy that leaves a mark - a village eaten by zombies, a breach between the Material Plane and the Negative Energy Plane, the creation of a particularly powerful free-willed undead...
        And you can seize control over a 'door' that now exists in your spirit. The bigger the necromantic mark, the more that was sacrificed, the more potent the forces created or unleashed, the greater the door. That door can be opened, once.
That door can be opened, once.
*To either greatly empower a single act of necromancy.
*To necromantically empower you in a specific, limited, but permanent way. For example, permanently empowering a single spell, power, or similar effect you can invoke with a necromantic blessing.
*Gain a new spell, power, or similar. Spells gained this way are cast like a good aligned clerics spontaneous cure spells.
*As fuel to create an epic spell.
*The ability to cast extra epic spells per day, as long as they’re ‘appropriate’ to the dark forces you gained them from.
*A wish granted. Not as the spell, as a favor paid. Coin of value from the dark forces.
And yes, the power from a door can empower you to greater necromantic heights, so that you can create another greater door, from which you can gain better benefits.


-Carpenter Ant (SimAnt) (600CP)
        A lack of hands or other manipulators is little more than a playful challenge for you now when it comes to crafting. This won't help you build computers out of stones but it will assist in shaping and sculpting simple structure and tools from the material available to you. Materials seem to just crack, chip, splinter and mold into whatever simple shape you want as long as you apply the effort and intent.


-Create the Heavens and the Earth (The Magician - TV show) (600CP)
        You are a creator first and foremost. While most Deities simply reside over creations, you create them and more. With this perk your ability to "create" is massively boosted, and when it comes to creating things your accuracy in doing so, being through divine powers or through mundane practice, is astounding to say the least.
        Regardless of your Origin, you gain the ability to create any object, mundane or Magical, if you're normally able to create Magical items or enchant the things you're trying to make without this ability that is, that's the size of or smaller than the average Human, assuming you're willing to foot the cost in the Magical energy it would take to make the base mundane item and fuel the enchantments needed.
        This perk cannot reproduce things that require other esoteric methods of payment in the enchanting or creation process of a Magic item, such as the expenditure of experience, the usage of souls, or the power of love.
        This process can take anywhere from milliseconds to around ten seconds depending on the size of it and how Magical it is. Any existing abilities that allow you to create things are significantly boosted in potency, and anytime you bequeath any of your internal energies in some way to another it is incredibly boosted in potency, to the point where if you were a Deity and you gave someone a part of yourself to consume for temporary power, you could decide for it to instead boost them to near Deity levels for a short duration instead of the average Master Magician boost people normally get from such an action.


-Doctor Stylish (Medaka Box Abnormal) (600CP)
        Styles are quite special, even among Skills. Makeable, if you know the right way, and capable of just as much power and even some things Skills cannot do. You're a Stylist equal to Fukurou, the creator of Styles, himself. Just by constantly using, considering and playing with a certain phrase, idiom, way of using words or other word-related game, you can create new styles. Things on the level of Provocation Style might take just a few weeks whilst a mid-level style like Label User or Kanji user might take months of repetition. The high level stuff can take years or even longer to make, such as Contradictory Conjunction, but is still possible if you are patient and uninterrupted in your work. You'll also find that you effortlessly master any sort of word-based supernatural power, possessing much more strength than any of your peers would with the same sorts of powers at your normal Level.
        Capstone Boosted: The next step of Styles is to take them from being original to converting other things into Styles. You're able to create new Styles by converting existing power and abilities you have into Styles, though this does not remove the original version of the power. The power will still require any energy or material costs as normal and possesses most of the same drawbacks but any sort of physical action required or time requirement is reduced to just a few words needing to be spoken by you. You could be able to cast any of your fire spells simply by saying Fire with different inflections and tones or unleash barrages of blasts of kinetic forces by reciting technique names from martial arts.


-Exalted Ways Dominance (Generic Exalted) (600CP)
        As one of the Dragon-blooded you were trained from birth to excel in the areas in which you showed talent, and you showed a great many talents indeed. Choose any seven of the following - War, Melee, Martial Arts, Archery, Thrown, Riding, Sailing, Socializing, Athletics, Awareness, Dodge, Bureaucracy, Crafting, Integrity, Investigation, Larceny, Linguistics, Lore, Medicine, Occult, Performance, Presence, Stealth, Survival, or Resistance. You are now the undisputed master of those seven skills. This is in addition to any skills or abilities you would normally be good at on account of your Caste or 'favored' choices.
        You can do things with the seven skills you have chosen while half drunk and blind on your worst day that the greatest mortal practitioners would never be able to replicate, even on their best day, in their entire lives. Additionally you can train anyone that you personally tutor in these seven abilities and they will quickly reach a level of skill close to, but just short of, your own level of skill. They will learn at a rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt.
        If you chose Dodge you might one day be able to walk through a rainstorm without getting wet. If you choose Archery you might strike a man's heart from over the horizon while he is standing in the middle of a forest. If you chose Bureaucracy the sheer efficiency and speed with which your organization operates will baffle even the most astute observers and leave competitors hopelessly scrambling to catch up. Choosing Medicine might allow you to perform brain surgery with a rusty knife using only one hand, and have the patient come out the other side perfectly healthy. Point blank the things you can manage with your chosen skills would be outright impossible for nearly anyone else to replicate, even other Essence users needing to 'cheat' and use Charms in order to match what you can do with nothing but your own innate talent. You may purchase this perk up to three times, each time it is purchased you must select different abilities.


-Forging The Spear of Destiny (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1) (600CP)
        To strike down evil, one must wield the appropriate weapon. It is for that cause, of aiding not only your fellows but the next generation who will live long past your own end, that you have taken the blacksmithing techniques of the Dragunity clan to a new level. Forging innately magical weapons, capable of summoning minor firestorms or striking with flensing wind, is simplicity itself for you. But where you truly shine is in the forging of power itself. Rendering a bolt of lightning into a spear, quenching shaped magical energy until it is a fine rapier, or even extracting the necrotic energies within an undead and refining it into an arrowhead, are all possible with some work. However, you are not limited to such easily visible forms of power. Should they cooperate, or prove incapable of resisting, you may forge a person's very power into a magical item reflecting their nature and capabilities. Perhaps even pool the power of multiple persons into a single weapon even greater than them although, it's not an idea you've had the chance to test, sadly. Parting with one's power forevermore is something not many can seriously consider.


-Magma Blacksmith (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (600CP)
        Breaking the enemy in half with your bare hands and setting fire to anyone who tries to stop you works just fine for most Lavals, but that's no excuse to slack off when it comes to making weapons. Besides learning any kind of blacksmithing twice as fast as your peers, you're already a living legend. You can forge obsidian swords that cut straight through solid steel even when swung by a child, and your suits of stone armor would let people comfortably walk inside an erupting volcano or trek through a raging snowstorm. But you're not letting yourself stop there. With a special quenching technique wherein you use a lava flow instead of water or oil, you can reinforce any material or equipment capable of withstanding the required temperatures, improving physical qualities like hardness or sharpness thrice over.


-Matching and Mixing (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (600CP)
        If Mixing combines different ingredients to create new objects, like combining various plants to make powerful healing potions, what happens when you combine two or more of the same thing? Normally, nothing, it's a total waste of ingredients. It's not entirely impossible to find a way past that limitation and when you found that way, you rocketed past it to new heights of crafting power. You're able to combine multiples of the same thing to increase its overall power and utility. This can range from combining many corpses of the same being to create a super strong golem under your command to combining many Shining Weapons into one Frankenstein weapon that can channel an unholy shit-load of power at once.


-Non-Euclidean Mind (Generic Creepypasta) (600CP)
        Unique insight into the nature of reality has given you the somewhat troubling ability to bend space, or at least build structures that bend space. You can build things like buildings that are much bigger on the inside than their exterior would suggest, tunnels and halls that cross continents, even a series of connected spaces that randomly move you between them whenever you enter a door. The limiting factor is that you'd need to spend the same amount of resources as constructing the actual structure would be, although thankfully you won't need to spend as much time; a bigger on the inside house would use the amount of materials that the bigger insides suggest, for example. In addition, your twisted mind helps protect from mind reading, as your mind is as labyrinthine as your creations.


-Omni Crafting (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (600CP)
        Most Support classes are limited to one general area of work. Healers mix potions and medicines, constructors mix buildings and fortifications, smiths mix weapons and armour. Command and Passive spells only apply to your specialty, just like how someone who trains to become a blacksmith won't get any better at painting or drawing up building plans. You're some kind of Omni-Support class that not just ignores these limits, it shatters the very idea that you'd be so limited. Your crafting and Mixing abilities in one area can be used for any form of crafting or Mixing. Abilities that would normally improve the potency of your potions instead improve the power of your created weapons and vice versa. This also applies to your raw skills, allowing you to use skills in one crafting/creative discipline for other areas of work. That said, the skill scaling is a little weaker, in that only very broad specialties will carry over the full effect, while more specific forms of creating things gives a small benefit to other skills.


-Programming Miracles (Alterworld 2.4) (600CP)
        The metaphysics of this world allow for some interesting things to happen. Creating a fully realized dimension with its own malleable laws and rules is something common place though such a thing was never intentional. The Perma Effect caused many new worlds to spring into being from the playgrounds of humanity, video games become more than their intended distractions from reality and become real in themselves all through the power of belief and the divine spark of a human soul. By buying this perk you can take a little of this divinity with you, you become an able game designer and programmer. Someone who could create entire worlds from scratch with amazing amounts of detail. People would be astounded to see the worlds you create. This on its own is amazing but that is not all, by merely getting enough people to willingly play your game in your world you can slowly split it off into its own self contained world. The numbers are not low, requiring a large amount of people to play for extended amounts of time before your world begins to go from unreal to real. A minimum of 200,000 souls all playing in your world all believing in it and wishing it was real will be your lower threshold for such a feat, that is your minimum threshold to start an unreal world down its path become a real world of its own. Surely you can pull that off, yes? You can toggle this effect if you wish to simply craft some of the best games around and not have them become miniature world of them own I guess. If you were into that.


-Sacrificial Smith (Overlord - Games ) (600CP)
        If there is a tradition between all those Overlords and what they did, then that is using minions to empower whatever they forge, usually by having those that just spawned jump in the smelter in order to empower what is gonna be crafted. And you can not only do the same thing, so long you sacrifice minions in some way that involves the crafting process of what you are making.


-Sublimation (Fate/Legends - Vive La France) (600CP)
        Originality and uniqueness may certainly be the king of the high class art world but that's only when people can tell it's there. If not, a revision works just as well. Sublimation is the name of this capability you now have, which allows you to reproduce objects you have a chance to study and 'revise' them in the process, like stealing and rewriting a play.
        You'll need the desired item as a catalyst but this will let you slowly make copies of it, quality depending on the time and resources you invest into each one. A few hours is usually all it takes but already powerful items can take expensive, rare or dangerous to acquire materials to remake. More uniquely, your revision ability allows you to alter these catalysts. Again, basing the extent of the effect on time and resources, but you can certainly make a magical sword several times as powerful or add numerous new abilities to it, altering it's history or composition so that it always had those qualities.
        Perhaps a cart of raw materials from the local town square is all it'd take to take an ordinary iron blade and make it sharp enough to cut metal and alight in flame on command. But improving an already legendary blade like Durandal even moderately could take fortune's worth of materials that would already be difficult to attain, even for a king. There is not technically a limit on how far an object may be revised, though the cost of doing so will continue to grow greatly. Of course, selling your reproductions and revisions would certainly help build the fortune needed for something big.


-Titanic Mind, Tiny Body (The Circumstances Leading to Waltraute's Marriage) (600CP)
        It's rare that the dwarves let one of their grandmaster craftsmen out into the world. You must just be that special. You're a master unmatched by all but a tiny few at crafting all manner of magical and mundane objects, most of your peers being dwarves like yourself. Gungnir, Mjolnir, Gleipnir, these legendary objects and more are some of the things you could make, provided the time and resources were available. You are equally skilled at modifying already existing things too, finding it no different to add more onto an item than if you were making it from the ground up, even if it was already a complex mechanism. Lastly, all that you make carries a powerful dwarven curse that will afflict and harm any who use it without your permission, even those on a Divine level. This curse will cause terrible ailments and sicknesses to the trespasser until they have properly repented to you.


-World's Maker | Pandora's Child (Campione) (600CP)
        World's Maker (0CP)
        Chant: My inspiration is unending. My creations are peerless. My tools are unrivaled. My hands shall give birth to perfection only. For of all makers I reign as supreme Effect: Three effects come into play when this Authority is called forth. First, the user's creativity will be elevated to top even the greatest of artists, for the purpose of designing what he chooses to create. Second, a set of tools shall appear, perfect for whatever creation the user wanted to make. Third, the user shall gain temporary knowledge of magic to enchant, curse or bless his creation as he had envisioned. Be it buildings, songs, weapons, armor or the likes, even with the worst materials something that borders the divine can be made. Downsides: The user must have something he wants to make before calling the Authority. The materials are not provided for this. Depending on the creation, the time spent making it will vary. Once a project has been started, the Authority won't let another start until the first is done.
        Pandora's Child (600CP)
        Ah, the Campione, the unrivaled humans that managed the impossible: to slay a deity by themselves. They are Pandora's adopted children and the owners of a few advantages. Now, you're one of them too. As a Campione, you gain an all around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn't have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay. Don't get too lazy because of this, I must warn you, many Campiones have fell after relying too much on their natural advantages, since there are ways to go around them.


-Hammer And Anvil | Gimmick and Trick | Fire and Ice (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (700CP)
Hammer And Anvil (100CP)
        It'd hardly be right to call you a smith if you couldn't even bang out a piece of metal, eh? You're a seasoned blacksmith, able to work metal and create all manner of useful metal objects - horseshoes, charms, and emblems...and of course, weapons and armor. The weapons and armor you create are reliable and easy to make, the kind used by Travelers and Soldiers all around Hyrule.
Gimmick and Trick (200CP)
        Arrows are a vital resource, not in the least because they are simple and easy to adjust. With your help, the humble arrow can go from a projectile to a problem solver! You now know how to make the 'trick' arrows utilized in Hyrule, the elemental arrows of fire, lightning and ice as well as the explosive bomb arrows. If you wished, you could extend this tinkering habit to non-projectiles, allowing you to create gimmick weapons and tools similar to that created by Kilton, proprietor of the Fang and Bone. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, the quality of your crafted items is increased - allowing you to craft weapons of the quality of non-Hylian special weapons such as the Drillshaft or Gerudo Scimitar, or the quality of the weapons used by the Knights of Hyrule.
Fire and Ice (400CP)
        The mark of a true journeyman of the trade, you have learned how to infuse elemental properties into the weapons you've forged, as well as create the entirely elemental weapons known as Rods. Though both of these require some 'infused' mystical energy to make, once forged anyone can wield them. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil and Gimmick and Trick, your crafting expertise is now such that you could create weapons worthy of the Royalty of Hyrule itself, granted to their guardians or rewarded to those who have shown great skill as a hero - yet nothing quite unique. Not yet.


-Builder Package Tier One | Tier Two | Tier Three | Fragment of the Dream (Generic Island Castaway) (1100CP)
        Builder Package Tier One (100CP)
        Wood and other plant life. You are an exceptional builder with these and know the characteristics of such materials at a glance, you can also form mental blueprints and interact with them as if you actually saw them in the real world to assist in construction, as well as making infallible mental checklists of materials with exact steps, materials, and dimensions needed for the build, you also have an easy time locating useful materials you need for building and you take less time to build than you should.
        Builder Package Tier Two (200CP)
        Stone and crystals, you may now treat the builder package tier one as if it applies to these as well. You are also exceptionally good at locating and harvesting your needed materials while maximizing their yield and minimizing lost or damaged materials.
        Builder Package Tier Three (400CP)
        Metals and processed chemicals, treat these as if they also applied to the first two tiers, in addition to everything you construct now being far more durable than it would otherwise seem and taking less materials to construct than it should, you can also refine them to modern standards despite primitive conditions and lack of equipment.
        Fragment of the Dream (400CP)
        You carry within you a fragment of the God that dreamed up this island, boosting all the perks that you have purchased here. All purchased Builder tiers are boosted to supernatural levels, tier one now allows you to let others see your mental blueprints and cuts construction time to a fraction of what it should be, tier two now allows you to harvest larger amounts of the given materials then are physically present and causes the material site to slowly repair itself over time and tier three now allows you to apply desired characteristics to materials and construct things as if you had tools even if you don't.


-Mastercraft | Of the Elder Blood (The Witcher Novels) (1200CP)
        Mastercraft (700CP)
        What separates a Master from an Apprentice? No, not the fact that the current Master married his teacher's only daughter and inherited his position in the guild. A True Master of his craft is person whose work is akin to art. Perhaps even the Art snobbish sorcerers like to call their magic, because when someone looks at what was made by your hand they cannot believe it is not magic. When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it.
        Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make. This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don't suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business.
        Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are. They may not be able to surpass you but your legacy will live on through them and their work, and the work of their students and beyond, forever immortalizing your name. Even if history may not remember your other deeds expect to become a folklore hero in the future.
        Oh, and good news to you who are Gnomes! You are now also a master metallurgist and have mastered the art of Gwyhyr blades, which are known to be among the greatest weapons ever forged on the continent, with each blade being a masterful work of art. Those unfortunate enough not to be Gnomish may also gain this understanding of their metallurgy and metalworks.
        Of the Elder Blood (500CP)
        It appears that you are an unaccounted for relative of Ciri, by way of Laura Dorren, being an active carrier of the Elder Blood, as it seems that you can travel in the local multiverse; from shifting through time and space to crossing through worlds like stepping through a door, though your control over your ability is rather crude and in dire need of training before it becomes useful. But be wary, refining such a gift is a dangerous process, for the worlds are filled not just with wonders but horrors as well - how else do you think the monsters that witchers hunt appeared, other than when the worlds collided long ago?




 --- Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy (27) (23 Perks) --- 


-Oblation to Onsi (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        From separating the low-carbon steel from the high-carbon steel to identifying obscure metals like Lilandril steel and the so-called "bog iron" found in peat deposits, you've got a solid basis of knowledge and skills that allow you to work as a blacksmith for all but the most discerning of clients (and with practice, even those as well!) Any set of plate or any melee weapon crafted from metals of up to Rank Five (ebony, which for some reason is much less impressive in ESO than it is in every other Elder Scrolls setting) is a trivial task for you, provided you have the tools and resources on hand.


-Smith (Generic Builder) (100CP)
        You have a particular talent for creating anything a blacksmith/armorsmith/weaponsmith might create. Any such crafted object is half again as durable as it would otherwise be. Creation times are halved and your natural talent increases with each purchase of this knack.
        * Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers


-Blacksmithing (Golden Sun) (200CP)
        You gain understanding of Weyard blacksmithing. While skilled in smithing typical metals, you also learn how to use strange and magical materials to forge powerful enchanted weapons, equipment, and artifacts. Power is decided by your personal skill, the magic of the material involved, and the quality of your forge. Items created with materials from Weyard typically require the user to be an adept to tap into their strength.


-Crafting: Armorsmithing (Aion SB) (200CP)
        You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. For an included upcharge, your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting.


-Crafting: Weaponsmithing (Aion SB) (200CP)
        You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. For an included upcharge, your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting.


-Goron Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You know the secrets of the Goron Craftsmen. You can create metal armors that can render the wearer immune to heat, powerful hammer-blades that can smash through the toughest rocks, advanced Bomb Arrows that won't explode from ambient heat, and more. Anything built by Gorons, you can recreate, so long as you can gather the right materials.


-Smithing (Thundercats 2011) (200CP)
        The ancient art of working with metal to forge weapons and armor. You know how to make beautiful equipment that can survive countless battles and you could even forge a legendary weapon if you dedicated enough time to it, although it'd probably take at least several years to complete.


-Smithing (Wakfu) (200CP)
        You know how to make weapons and armor from all sorts of raw materials. From Scarabug wings to Blibli tusk and Gobball hooves, you can turn just about anything you'd find in nature into genuine combat equipment the more powerful the creature it came from, the stronger the equipment will be.


-Zora Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You have the skills of a Zora Craftsman. You can create suits of flexible armor that boost the wearer's ability to swim, mighty spears and tridents, powerful Ice Arrows that leave waves of cold in their wake, and more. Any item or structure that a Zora has built, you can recreate, given time and appropriate materials.


-Alloy Smith (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (300CP)
        Advanced knowledge of chemistry and metallurgy has allowed you to create alloys out of various materials, including metals and chemicals. These new alloys retain all of the properties- including those that are supernatural in nature- of the materials used to make them, allowing you to create truly powerful substances.


-Blacksmith (Generic Xianxia) (300CP)
        Weapons and armour are not useless in this world. Indeed, one of sufficient talent may create arms and armour that can (and usually do) mean the difference between victory and defeat for those who use them. You are able to make equipment with special traits and great power to aid the one who wields and wears them. What the gear is able to do and how strong it is is dependent on your skill, the processes used, and the reagents that go into their creation - for example, if you wanted to make a flaming sword, you would need a source of magical or conceptual fire to infuse into the blade. With sufficient time and skill the stuff you make can decide the fate of nations, planets, and even entire dimensions. Furthermore the arms and armor you can create are nearly half-again as powerful as they would otherwise be, given similar materials, time, and effort in their creation.


-Blacksmithing: Zen Master (World of Warcraft) (300CP)
        Smith various melee weapons, mail and plate armor, and other useful trade goods like skeleton keys, shield-spikes and weapon chains to prevent disarming. Blacksmiths can also make various stones to provide temporary physical buffs to weapons.
        At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on an even playing field with the top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-Blessed By A God: Blacksmithing (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (300CP)
        Gain a blessing from one of the recorded gods, gaining a boost in whatever skill or stat they stand for. Additionally, you exemplify that skill or trait, standing heads and shoulders above all others in that field. These gods and goddesses cover just about every domain and aspect there is, from fire to beauty to magic.

-Superhuman Skill: Blacksmithing Cosmic Level (Generic Super Academy) (400CP)
        You possess greater than human levels of skill in a single occupation. You could be a superhuman sniper, martial artist, mechanic, chef, or any other area of skill. You may purchase additional occupations for an extra 100CP each. At Street Tier you are slightly above what a normal human could achieve. This level in skill is equivalent to Bullseye's accuracy or Lady Shiva's fighting skill. At National Tier you can achieve feats of skill that would normally only be possible with machine-like perfection. You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform delicate brain surgery with a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that inspires a national revolution within days. At Global Tier the laws of physics become flexible when you practice your skills. You can bend bullets Wanted style, balance on a cloud, or swim up a rainstorm. At Cosmic Tier things get a little ridiculous. Your skills acquire conceptual level effects. You could shoot someone by targeting their shadow, dodge bad luck, or repair spatial rifts with duct tape and bailing wire.


-Blessing of Dundr (The Banner Saga) (400CP)
        You received the blessing of Dundr as he left the world, and received the boon of the god of smithing and knowledge. You gain godly talent in learning how to smith and can weave stories that capture and entertain people on equal footing of the greatest bards.


-Dwarven Craft (Lord of the Rings) (400CP)
        You are a master smith, able to single handedly run even a large forge. You can make weapons and armor that stand up to hundreds of years of continuous use, and even know how to mine and forge mystical metals such as Mithril


-Incredibly Talented: Blacksmithing (In Another World With My Smartphone) (400CP)
        There is one area in which you truly shine. Pick a single skill or talent such as hand to hand, swordsmanship, magical innovation, alchemy, or similar focus. You are now, hands down, one of the best people in the world in that subject.
        An alchemist could come up with all sorts of new alchemical concoctions and potions that would astound and amaze your peers, a swordsman could cut down a hundred men on his own nearly effortlessly, a magical innovator could create new spells or rituals or magical items with unsurpassed vision and creativity, and similar such potency applies to any other skill or focus you take with this perk.
        Beyond that however you will always be able to refine your focus, allowing you to push yourself to greater and greater heights no matter how skilled you become. You may purchase this perk more than one, but it must apply to a new skill or focus each time it is taken.


-Flesh and Steel (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (600CP)
        Clothes can make the man, you've learned. It might be possible for someone to perform great feats of stealth in bulky plate, but even someone with that kind of skill would be much better served with the appropriate wear, right? And the tales of those with shining and enchanted armor allowing the hero to survive impossible odds are common - the hammer that could forge such a thing is now in your hands. With this skill, you can create armor and accessories(such as rings, jewelry, and armbands) that directly imbue the wearer with supernatural power, physical boosts, and prowess in certain skills. With this, you could create amber earrings that make one tougher, or a suit of armor that allows you to swim faster! In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, Gimmick and Trick and Fire and Ice - your weapon crafting skill is among the legendary smiths of old, able to create the kind of weapons only worthy of the 4 Champions of Hyrule itself, matching the mythic weapons of Hyrule such as the sword of Biggoron or the Six Sages!


-Forgemaster (Marvel Magic) (600CP)
        You are skilled in the art of the forge. You craft weapons and shape armor in the way a master artist plies their trade. Perhaps you trained with a god of the forge or studied under the dwarves of Nidavellir or maybe you've simply honed your skills over lifetime's. Whatever the case, your skill with the forge goes beyond what normal mortals would be able to accomplish. You have the skill to work with metals; though perhaps not the natural hardiness required to survive the conditions needed to forge them. And even were you to only have sub-par mundane materials, you could still craft weapons and armor fit for any king who has ever lived. Further, if you know how to utilize the mystic arts, you will find yourself talented at enchanting your creations with your spells and perhaps you will even be able to forge great and powerful artifacts. But the modern world has largely moved beyond the crude weapons of old and if you wish, you may do so as well. With some effort you would be able to transfer your skills to more advanced components, creating powerful firearms or masterful mechanical vehicles.


-The Creator: Blacksmithing (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (600CP)
        Pick one area of creation. This could be blacksmithing, cooking, enchanting, or more. You now are the undisputed master of that craft. A blacksmith would be able to make unique and legendary class weapons by the dozen while cooks could make the tastiest food in all the realms, using previously thought inedible ingredients, so good that they may even have special effects like recovering stamina or health, or boosting your stats equivalent to ten levels for several minutes at a time. With time and effort you will only increase in ability, your growth uncapped in that area.


-Master Smith | Ahzidal's Apprentice (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (800CP)
        Master Smith (400CP)
        So, how many iron daggers did this take to get? Regardless of the answer to that question the results have surely shown themselves to you and everyone else. You're a master of smithing and the working of metal, forging weapons out of Glass and Ebony is well within your capacity, and even Daedric items may be forged with proper equipment and materials. Your craftsmanship is nothing less than perfection and your opportunity to grow is great as well. Given times you may yet forge tools, weapons and armor that rival even the likes of Daedric artifacts.
        Ahzidal's Apprentice (400CP)
        The art of spellcasting has more to it than just flinging fireballs and screaming about UNLIMITED POWER as one electrocutes their enemies. The arts of Enchantment and Alteration stand as testaments to this fact, enchantment in particular stands as a powerful, yet indirect system of magic and when it comes to this branch and the operation of it only the Dragon Priest Ahzidal is your equal. Like him you've collected vast knowledge pertaining to the various magical bases of the Mer, whether it be the ancient runes of the Ayleids or the process of harmonizing the seven natures of metal. This craft extends far and wide and with it even a mere band of 500 warriors could be given equipment powerful enough to fell a powerful race of spellcasters like the Falmer, or in other, more simple words your enchantments are legendary. You could perhaps go even further, runes are simply another language, and if understanding them allows you to use them, then perhaps even others like that of the Dovah might be as well.
        This is lore based Daedric artifacts which includes shit like instant kill weapons or key that can conceptually unlock anything. Or a sword that stole power from a daedra and flew a floating city of soul warriors into mundus. Pretty much all major Daedric artifacts are conceptual even if they are nerfed for the game.


-Divine-Smith/S Rank | Falna (Danmachi) (1000CP)
        Divine-Smith/S Rank (1000CP)
        Unlike the original Blacksmith this version grants you the ability to add multiple magical abilities and powers that you have access to in your creations along with infinite usage of this magical abilities and powers. At max rank it would allow you to create a divine item and add a maximum of twelve magical abilities and powers that has greater power, utility and effectiveness compared to the magic swords of this world.
        Falna (0CP)
        The blessings of a god or goddess are given to you. Your abilities, as well as any skills you develop, are portrayed upon your back and your God/Goddess can update them for you. Each level up potentially allows you to gain a developmental ability and gain skills every time you gain a new greater goal, realization, enlightenment or conviction allowing you to potentially gain new skills based on those. For 300cp would upgrade the Falna that you received that guarantees that you would gain a developmental ability and skill every time you level up and after this jump the perks, abilities and skills that you gained from the past to the future would be translated and displayed into a skill, magic and developmental ability that you can improve along with the Falna automatically updates periodically. You can also view your Falna in your mind or let others see your back to view your status along with it automatically integrating any existing System that you have access gained all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible. The one that would give you the Falna is the God/Goddess of the Familia that you choose in the Familia Section and if you are a God/Goddess you can give yourself a Falna even if it's not possible in cannon or the companion that took the God/Goddess Origin. After this jump you are given an option on either retaining this System or not and if you choose to abandon this System all the developmental ability, magic and skills that you have would become a perk allowing you to use them without the assistance of the Falna.




 --- Domain: Crafting: Technological (28) (42 Perks) --- 




-Bandit Gunsmith (Borderlands) (100CP)
        You have amazing technical insight and when shown a pile of broken weapons or energy shields you can use parts from some to reassemble others into decent condition. Don't expect it to be pretty, but you can nail 15 repeater pistols together to make a functional shotgun, or use bits of five shields to make one that works.


-Big Bada-Boom (Azeroth) (100CP)
        You may not make the prettiest of engineering gizmos, but boy do you know how to make them go BOOM! You can make big bombs or little bombs or big bombs IN little bombs capable of taking out an entire skyscraper. You are an expert at bomb crafting, able to make bombs the size of a marble that would make even Deathwing flinch. This also extends to defusing bombs if, for some reason, you don't want a boom, but that's just crazy talk.


-Gunsmith (Alpha Protocol) (100CP)
        People always forget that all Guns need some sort of maintenance, thankfully unlike other people you know and can easily maintain as well as repair almost any modern gun, and you also have a solid basis for learning how to maintain and repair or customize almost any gun that you can get your hands on, in fact your skill right now is good enough that you can at least ensure that whatever gun you clean up and maintain personally will never jam for whatever reason, who knows what you will be able to do in the future.


-Hammer Jammer (MtG - Bablovia) (100CP)
        Sometimes, all you need is a hammer. You've become insanely good at all sorts of Do-it-Yourself work and inventing gadgets, even with unusual parts. They might seem crude and useless from the outside, but the contraptions you invent do their job just fine. You also become good at repairing things, there's nothing you and your hammer can't fix.


-Laboratory Work (IOU) (100CP)
        Given a few hours and suitable tools you can almost always come up with a set of disposable tools that will counter a given gadget or ability you've encountered in the past. It'll only work once or twice, but with good sense that might be all you need.


-Tool King (Modded Fallout) (100CP)
        Starting with a cartload of random junk and ending with high-quality ammunition or power cells, cutting-edge improvements to power armor, overcharged laser weaponry or even entirely new kinds of science is practically trivial for the average Fallout protagonist yet their talents pale compared to yours. This Perk grants you immediate access to pretty much any kind of crafting shown in the Fallout series: from Hand Loader to Science! and Chemist to Robotics Expert, if it somehow involves building things out of other things (from guns to ammo to even entire buildings), you've got it - including perfectly memorized designs for the kind of components and tools you might need, like the Robotics Workbench or Nuka-Cola Mixer station. In fact, you're good enough that you'll never make mistakes while doing this type of crafting (assuming someone doesn't start shooting at you or some such), and you'll be perfectly aware of where you were in the process if you do find yourself interrupted and have to continue later on.


-Connector (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
        Switches and wiring may seem rather simple on the surface, but there is a host of complexity lurking just under the surface. After all, these skills were why the Mechanic was kidnapped, to help with rebuilding the lost body parts of the Moon Lord for his cult. You are not quite at that level yet, but you do now have a large amount of skill in designing networks and working out how to bring all of the moving parts together to create something greater. Actuators, sensors, conveyors and more, you can construct extremely complex mechanisms and arrange location and timing so that they all work together smoothly. Eventually, it is entirely possible that you could develop plans for building things like the Mechanical Bosses.


-Enhanced I.C. Chip (Mega Man Classic) (200CP)
        You know how to create stronger I.C. chip, these chips from the core of a robots personality, it's memory and the likes. Stronger chips are less fragile and less susceptible to reprogramming. Any sapient machine you make will retain their own personality, even though virus attacks and so long as the chip remains intact, they can outlive their body.


-Fingers of the North Star (Cave Story) (200CP)
        You have a natural talent with machinery, and this extends to firearms creation. You can disassemble, analyze, and reassemble any projectile weapon you come across, and you have the ability to create unique, one of a kind guns that utilizes odd and esoteric technology. You also gain a free 'stamp' you can apply to any weapon you create, to show it's your work. Upgrading existing weapons is a breeze as well.


-Legendary Craftsman (Modded Fallout) (200CP)
        Remember all those unique prototype weapons with crazy awesome effects? The Legendary items in Fallout 4? The games have had their fair share of 'better than normal' items, and you know just how to make them. You have the ability to substantially improve whatever items you work on, needing at most enough components to build a second copy of the item in question. Whether it's dumping half your power cell into each shot a la Pew-Pew, making every bullet fired by your Minigun into an explosive round, or crafting armor that boosts your stats with no regard for how or why it works, you've got it all. Never again will you need to worry about being unable to find that Two-Shot or Instigating Gauss Rifle! You'll even be able to (slightly) fudge where those unique effects could be found, like making Power Armor with special effects or a Gatling Laser that does fire explosive rounds. Beams. Whatever.


-Maliwan Intern (Borderlands) (200CP)
        At some point, you got lucky and figured out how Elemental Weapons really work. You know how to use them to best effect, allowing you to set enemies on fire regularly, melt people with acid bullets, and have ALL kinds of shocking adventures with electrical ammo. If you have any technical training, you can even jury-rig ways to apply elemental effects to other weapons, as well.


-Rotary Slug Thrower (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Those aren't usually automatic you have a gift for rapid-firing weapons, and modifying weapons to fire faster. Never enough dakka.


-The Love of Lightning (Fate/Grand Order) (200CP)
        Steam Power! Coal! Electricity! The Nuclear Age! All the greatest revolutionaries have brought new power with them, their obsessions letting them take great bounds over the opposition to advance all of humanity. You share that same potential with one form of technological power, greatly advancing your skill and potential when dealing with technology that uses it. It could be electricity powered tech, steam powered tech or even wind powered tech. Whatever you choose, you'll be able to make them much stronger, much more efficient and much cheaper than you normally could. Not all energies are exactly equal however, so you may still find yourself needing more resources than normal, though you'd still get the increased power and efficiency.


-Weapon crafting (Devil May Cry) (200CP)
        Alright, so you fancy yourself a weapons dealer, huh? Well now you know the ins and outs of every single tool made for killing that you get your crafty little hands on. Swords, handguns, axes, sniper rifles, spears, rocket launchers, it'll all come naturally to you, and you will be able to create these weapons or even improve them with your own custom designs. And to make it even a better deal, you know how to modify a weapon to have unlimited ammunition capability. So go nuts, buddy. You've earned it.


-Adventurous Engineering (Van Helsing) (300CP)
        You know the ins, outs, secrets, and quirks of the technology inherent in this age. As a result, you can engineer just about anything that will run on electricity, from a horseless carriage to the ever-powerful Tesla-Coil Cannon. You just need the parts, which shouldn't be hard to come by... Right? A quirk of Adventurous Engineering is that your technology always gains a bit of a Victorian flair to it.


-Gadgeteer (Young Justice) (300CP)
        An inventive mind and the know how to make gadgets; though they can't do anything too outside of normal physics, you are perfectly capable of making functional things like grappling hooks, tracking devices, boomerangs that automatically return to you, and trick arrows. In addition to being very cheap to make, any gadgets that you have are almost as intuitive to use as your very limbs, allowing you to use and switch between them easily and without hassle.


-High-Frequency Manufacturer (Metal Gear Rising) (300CP)
        A blade launderer, huh? Anyway, you can now make a HF blade out of anything you want. Depending on the original craftsmanship of the weapon, it could be good or shit. But if you picked this, you probably have something in mind. Must be a physical object. No lightsabers and the like. Yes, blunt objects can become HF weapons. No, they can't cut. They only get stronger, and can resist other HF weapons.


-I Can Fix It! (Reborn) (300CP)
        Technology is a wonderful thing, and you discovered that long ago. You have a knack for Flame rings and machines of all kinds, and can fix or maintain most machines. You can even improve them to beyond their normal specs. Comes with its own toolbox.


-Mechanist (Fallout 4) (300CP)
        You know what makes robots tick or beep. Not only can you repair and create them from scratch, but you can also cobble them together, creating some sort of robotic Frankenstein's Monster that's loyal to you and you alone while also incorporating all of the best components of the robots it's made.


-Robotics (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (300CP)
        Making robots and sentient AI is almost second nature to you, with the ease that you create them with. You also have knowledge of robotics in general, and can easily disable or hack one if you can access its software.


-Armored Jumper (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (400CP)
        You've got the know-how to create suits of power armor more along the lines of Crimson Dynamo in terms of size, though with much higher quality. Actually powering the armor is a bit trickier, as you lack the ability to make Arc Reactors with this alone, but it's possible that you can make an equivalent- or even run the armor off of something else entirely. With Sleek and Efficient, your armors can be closer to Tony Stark's in size.


-Clockwork Artist (Hellboy) (400CP)
        Kroenen is said to have created a clockwork bird capable of singing Mozart in his earlier days, though the assassin's love of music is less well known than the fear he inspired later in life. He is now more well known for his other clockwork inventions- namely his hand, and the clockwork mechanisms spread throughout his body that when wound up give the man his deadly strength, speed, and reflexes. You are capable of creating similar mechanical inventions, though you may lack the ability to self-modify to his extent without his love of pain and lack of blood.


-Game-breaking Union (Modded Fallout) (400CP)
        Mods are such funny things, change a few numbers here, tweak a few values there, and before you know it you've got miniguns that fire low-yield nukes and other such madness. Well, mad you may be, but it's certainly not weak. You have the strange and imposing ability to make modifications to your gear in ways that well, really shouldn't be. You're still limited to what you'd normally be able to build, but any kind of sensible limits on what kind of item the upgrades apply to goes right out the window. Attach jetpacks to your helmet, fire .308 cal armor-piercing rounds from a lightweight SMG with no penalties to its performance, and yes - install a MIRV Fat Man mod onto your Minigun and (somehow) blanket the world in nuclear annihilation at a rate of about thirty mushroom clouds per second or so. Might wanna put that Power Armor plating in your underwear first though


-Gimme a Tic (Gonna be the Twin-Tail) (400CP)
        They ain't never seen an engineer like yourself. You're not just able to keep up with some of the best and brightest in this world, such as creating teleporters that can be carried in your palm or energy shields that can offset a rocket launcher yet are contained within small pieces of jewellery, but you are also able to outright make what you design too. You work fast and hard, enough to do the work of dozens of skilled men working constantly over weeks of time in just a single night. You could construct a fully outfitted underground base beneath a house, excavating and manufacturing and coding all the gadgets and rooms and devices needed, within a single night and not leave anyone above ground aware of it.


-Industrialization (GURPS Technomancer) (400CP)
        Ah, mass production. Where would the world be without it? Nowhere special! Fortunately, you can spread this art with ease, even to things that most wouldn't expect it'd apply to! By gathering a few people capable of producing something, you can form them into a proper production line, no matter how special that item might normally be! What ONE ring? These amazing rings of invisibility are now being mass produced! Get yours now!


-Man and Machine (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP)
        The line between the two can be blurry in this world, but an engineer of your skills can make it vanish. You're a whiz with cybernetics of all kinds, able to design, build, repair, and even implant them with expert skill. Beyond just making the body embrace these additions as if they were natural if new parts of the whole your expertise allows you to work with and design implants and devices capable of all kinds of things. From in-built cloaking systems, dermal armor able to deflect and ignore military grade arms fire, dash systems, defensive fields, weapons, and much more. You could turn anybody from just another person into a walking example of posthumanity if you had the resources. Your talent in this field ensures you'll be able to adapt any of your technology into some form of useful cybernetic. Who knows where you'll take the field as time goes on.


-Mark Whatever (Satisfactorio-Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (400CP)
        You want to make a Mark 7 belt? Sure thing. You can create improved versions of your technology just by adding rarer and/or more processed materials to the recipe. These will not be as materially efficient as more of the lower-mark technology, but will be more efficient in other ways, including space or energy-per-effect.


-Mecha-Shift Prodigy (In The Kingdoms Service) (400CP)
        Students at the Combat Schools learn how to craft and maintain their own Mecha-Shift weapon, and yours was no different. Indeed, you proved to be a veritable prodigy at this, capable of turning metal and parts into some of the most complex handheld weaponry in the setting, so long as you have the tools. With additional training and experience, your skill can even branch out to non-weaponry uses of Mecha-Shift technology.


-Mechanic (Smash Up) (400CP)
        You can fix anything. Quite literally. Alien technology, magical artifacts. You may not even understand what they do or how they work, but you can see when they're broken and how to fix it.


-Retrofit+ (Azur Lane) (400CP)
        Let's face it, some Ship-girls are a little out of date when it comes to the tech department. That's what your standard retrofit is for, getting that old girl caught up with her peers. But, of course, this is a Perk, and nothing standard about it. By buying this Perk, you effectively un-cap all of your Ship-girls in terms of abilities. And you can keep retrofitting them, over and over, ad infinitum. Of course, it gets more expensive and the materials get more esoteric each time, but, it's a labor of love, right? As a bonus, along with the boosts to power, you might find that your Ship-girl starts to radically shift in physical appearance towards your tastes. Maybe that loli Destroyer will grow up, if you want her to. Or maybe you'll find Tennessee becoming softer and more cuddly as the successive Retrofits pile up. As long as you want it, it'll happen. Post-Jump you can do this to anyone, not just your Ship-girls, but you will still need reagents that fit with your target.


-Seamless Construction (Endless Space) (400CP)
        You might not be able to design the perfect ship, but you certainly could build one that is good enough. Given enough resources and the proper blueprints, you can build ships that would rival that of the Endless, cast as a single, cohesive whole. Even if you build it with mundane methods, it still ends up being nearly perfect, not a single design flaw or construction error in sight. This also applies to things you build that aren't spaceships.


-Super-Max (Generic City of Adventure) (400CP)
        There's not a single revolving door or scrap of cardboard in the defences you construct. Prisons, team headquarters, space outposts...wherever they are, whatever they're for, you can seamlessly integrate magical or super-tech materials into architecture without compromising function, style or habitability. Marble flooring pressure plates? Electronics mixed with clockwork backups to stymie technopaths? Getting the right mix of anti-demon salt mixed with cement to both look good and still keep them out? Easy. Of course, this perk includes enough architectural skill and artistic flair to make your own jumper-buildings look good, even with a giant glowing insignia on one side.


-Traps and Gizmos (Kingdom Hearts) (400CP)
        What do an ice cream machine, a present wrapping contraption, and a pair of gloves have in common? They're all powerful weapons! That is to say, with a bit of elbow grease and this perk you can make them into weapons. Not only can you weaponize rather unusual things, you also excel at creating traps and robots to ensure riff-raff leave you, your store, and your customers alone. You could make electrically charged gauntlets, toy dispensers that can take out Heartless, and candy makers that launch their delicious payload with enough force to knock grown men around.


-You Became A Star (Robot Unicorn Attack Gauntlet) (400CP)
        You've gained insight into the process of using rainbows to harness Unicornium without having it explode in your face. With it, you can build your own robot unicorns or other rainbow creatures. Once your initial adventure here concludes successfully you will be taught by an expert wishsmith on everything you might need to know to construct Wishes and design your own upgrades for them.


-Centurio Ordinatus (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (600CP)
        You have been inducted into the Divisio Militarus, a branch of the adeptus mechanicus dedicated to the construction and operation of the Ordinatus war machines, mighty titan-scale siege weapons of unparalleled power. While the shielding and mobility systems that carry these devices into battle are relatively simple to create, you understand the intricacies of how physics and performance are affected by up-sizing technology. With sufficient data on the function of a humble lasgun or arc rifle to extrapolate from, you could smoothly transition that device to function when a hundred or more times larger - and to be appropriately more powerful than the simple multiplication of its output would suggest. The weapons you create and oversee are fit for a god-machine to wield, and the likes of Nova Cannons and weapons arrays on board the largest ships of the Mechanicus are also within your purview.


-Gadgeteer (DC Arrowverse) (600CP)
        The world is a dangerous place, with supervillains and rogue metahumans. This is why you have science to help things out. You're able to make stuff that runs on comic book science. Be it shrinking technology, or a cold gun that fires just a few degrees above Absolute Zero. As long as you have the resources available and a working concept in your head the sky's the limit. Doesn't mean you'll get it right the first time around.


-Gadgeteer (GURPS Monster Hunters) (600CP)
        The supernatural? Unscientific? HAH! Monsters and magic are some of the most scientific things out there! Why, with just a bit of effort and some analysis, you can easily tinker up interesting new things from the corpse of a monster, or a countermeasure to a spell, or a device that negates psychic powers! A cord might prevent ghosts from crossing, a flashlight might have a portable fusion reactor to burn vampires, and your gun might auto-plate it's bullets with silver, and you're the one who makes and maintains it all!


-Lightning is my Art (Van Helsing) (600CP)
        You have twisted Tesla's theorems, plans, and experiments to whole new levels, creating tools and gadgetry capable of warping lightning and electricity to ends unseen by the man himself. You can give life to stitched-together golems and clockwork automatons with your tools, use electricity to manipulate, warp, or fracture objects to your individual needs, and even twist people into your warped, hunchbacked goons with your favorite flavor of electroshock therapy. Any technology made by you can run off of any electrical source you have access to (and is, in-fact, empowered for it), and has a Gothic London theme to it on a completely unrelated note.


-Perversions of the Natural Order (The Glass Scientists) (600CP)
        The laws of physics get very flexible when you're doing engineering. Usually in ways that benefit you. Conductors conduct slightly better, resistors are a little more resistant. As your projects grow in scale, so does this effect. You may even build mecha that ignore square-cube law. With enough time and resources, who knows? Reality can be whatever you want.


-Praesi Engineering (A Practical Guide to Evil) (600CP)
        If there is one thing that every Praesi Emperor has in common, it's the ability to take insane and ridiculous ideas and turn them into reality. Flying cathedrals that rain death upon their foes? Sentient tigers? Man eating tapirs? Giant cliffs to throw the hero down? WHY THE HELL NOT! You are capable of taking even the stupid and most insane engineering designs and throwing large amounts of magic at them until they work.
        Sure, this might require sacrificing a few towns worth of peasants, but that's the sort of thing that peasants are for.


-The Laws are Mine (Van Helsing) (600CP)
        The laws of such trivial things as physics, biology, chemistry, really any sort of recognized science are mere guidelines to you. You can break an established rule of scientific nature so long as it supports your goals and abilities. Anything from conservation of energy, to the conservation of matter, to the second law of thermodynamics in that entropy increases over time. Just... still... try not dividing by zero. I can't trust what will happen.


-Tinker Plus (Generic Worm Fanfiction) (800CP)
        You're not just a Tinker anymore, you're the Tinker. The PRT rating scale isn't really set up to handle someone like you because it assumes that Tinkers will have specialties, and you don't. You are something never seen before; a genuine omni-Tinker, and one of truly amazing capacity.
        Your aptitude and intuition for all sorts of research, science, engineering, and design is absolutely unbelievable. If a project is even halfway related to any of the hard sciences then you can get it done, and do so with a speed and efficiency that makes even experienced Tinkers working within their own specialities look like clumsy beginners. And you can rapidly reverse-engineer other technology given sufficient opportunity to study it, however complex or esoteric it might be. You can even study and analyze exotic and anomalous phenomena, such as cape powers in action, to hopefully gain inspiration for new Tinkertech.
        You have a volume knob in your head for making your designs either easily reproducible by mundane methods or totally blackboxed vs. any reverse-engineering or anything in between. You can perform what would have required clean room levels of precision assembly for mundane engineers with ordinary tools and under rough conditions. Troubleshooting or repairing tech that you already understand is a job you could practically do in your sleep, and anything you build or overhaul is maintenance-optional. With time and practice your Tinker abilities can improve and grow indefinitely, without any upper limit.
        You can't do things like 'perfected social sciences' or 'auto-win personal interaction methodologies', though. That sort of thing is for Thinkers, not Tinkers.




 --- Domain: Crafting: Magical Items (29) (79 Perks) --- 




-Beniemiya (Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (50CP)
        It might just be something in the water, both what you're drinking and what you serve to the guests that adore every meal you make. You're a savant when it comes to making meals, not just limited to Eastern dishes either. With a little experimentation, you can make almost anything into a mouth watering feast for both the taste buds and the eyes. The real problem isn't making a good meal but keeping all these greedy pigs from eating you out of house and home. Don't even try making hamburgers around any blonde ladies, it never ends well. Now, while cooking good food is a prize well worth it, you do also have a more useful aspect here. By channeling magical energy into your tools and ingredients as you work, you're able to 'enchant' the meal with a variety of useful effects. A hearty beef stew that lets a warrior heal their wounds much faster than normal, sugary sweets that give people the speed of the wind, a mighty hamburger that temporarily bulges the muscles to greater heights. Even negative effects are possible, if you want to taint your food that way. They only last for a temporary period and the effects tend to be fairly weak without a lot of mana put in but it makes your food all the more popular.


-Cult of the Gun (Enter the Gungeon) (100CP)
        What makes The Gungeon work? Magic. Duh. But, it's a specific type of magic: Gun magic, magic that makes objects more gun-like, or that accentuates the gun-like traits of non-gun objects. Unrestrained, it can turn a gun-like non-gun object, like a mailbox, into a gun, granting it a projectile and a firing method. The Gungeon does this passively, but you know how to direct this ability and use it to your advantage, taking any kind of object, and making it into a "gun," complete with the same perks that any gun-like object might gain. It's still fairly uncontrolled, with little if any say on your part as to what kind of weapon you get. How else do you explain, "guns," like a mailbox that fires letters and packages; a banana that fires explosive bananas; a bee hive that fires bees(duh); a camera that deals room-wide damage, knockback, and slowing; a guzheng that fires arrows when played; a pillow that fires zippers and stuns nearby enemies when reloaded; a crate that fires anvils; or a compressed air tank that fires homing sharks?


-Advanced Materials (XCOM 2) (200CP)
        As you experiment the physics and rules of a world ideas for new materials come to you. Elements and compounds from different universes often follow the same rules after all, so it should be theoretically possible to mix them. While you are developing new materials for your projects you will instinctively know whether or not materials will be compatible with each other and roughly how strong they will be. You will not know the exact ratio or procedure you will need to perform to fabricate these exotic materials, and it's not guaranteed that every material will be compatible with each other, but development will be made a lot easier.


-Amulet Crafting (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (200CP)
        Amulets, a more permanent form of magic, can also be enchanted by Mummies. Amulets can take many forms, from small pieces of jewelry to strips of paper. Making an amulet is a lengthy and expensive process, requiring much magical energy. Amulets can be crafted to ward against specific forms of damage, to improve one's attributes, or grant unique abilities such as cloud walking or invisibility.


-Artificer (Masters of Magic) (200CP)
        You begin the game already knowing the magics to create enchanted items (other wizards can eventually acquire them) and artifacts. Additionally, these items cost half as much for you to make, and take half the time. This allows you to equip heroes you hire in the early game. In future jumps, this will provide a slight boost to the creation time and a reduction to the creation cost of magical items.


-Downsized (Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath) (200CP)
        While gems the size of a room are the most efficient and stable, this perk will give you the skills necessary to create gems that are smaller than that. The strength of a gem relative to its cost scales with its volume, so small gems might seem useless at first glance, but gems effectively do not have an upper bound for how high they can scale. Feel free to make an Orb of Presence fit for a backpack, and carry around a staff with a gem on the top for blasting foes, or launch gem bombs the size of grenades and leave behind gem-wasps the size of flies to distract your foes.


-Eight-Fold Geomantic Mastery (Generic Exalted) (200CP)
        You possess the inherent understanding and skill with geomancy and the manipulation of natural energies such that you may now create manses in any area where such a thing could conceivably be created. The stronger the mystic or magical significance of a given place the more powerful the manse that can be built there, but even in the barest and most mystically barren areas you will still be capable of producing, given some time, a manse of the least (1-dot) power. The process of creating a Manse is tremendously faster for you than it would be for others, the necessary geomantic arrays and arrangements seeming to simply leap to your mind with a clarity of insight few if any could match. The Eight-Fold part of it is that you understand the methods for creating manses aspected towards all five of the elemental essences of fire, earth, wind, water, and wood as well as manses aspected towards solar, lunar, and stellar (sidereal) energies. Given time and effort you may discern methods for creating other types of manse, twisted mockeries of what nature intended, but such insights will take considerable effort, time, and resources to bear fruit. Taking this perk explicitly allows you to create manses even outside of Creation and, indeed, is the only way to create manses outside of Creation.


-Formations and Forging (World of Cultivation) (200CP)
        The basics of forging a new talisman lies in formations, by taking rare and powerful reagents and materials you can create powerful talismans to focus your power and grant you certain abilities. In its simplest form you could create such simple talismans as the earth turning hoe that ling farmers often purchase to help in their farming, while the highest levels are often dependent on the amount of time and the materials used by the forge. Such things as the earth turning sealing disc that creates the pressure of a thousand catties (1300 pounds) worth of weight upon another person for each spin of it, or the turtle style buddha ring formation which can protect an island from foes can be created. Many types of seal techniques are open to you now, it wall depends on what you are willing to do to master them.


-Grudge Forged (Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (200CP)
        Ibaraki-douji created her favoured bone sword by tearing out the bones of many Oni and setting them into a forge of her own terrible flames for hundreds of days. A way of sword smithing only a demon could manage, a brutal and unrefined method that results in a brutal and unrefined sword. But that sword is powerful, near unbreakable and holds the furious grudges of the Oni sacrificed to make it, giving the weapon a deadly cursed aura. This sort of feat is much more applicable to your skills now, as you find it far easier to turn your own innate abilities to the work of crafting things. A dragon's fire improves the quality of things forged in it, rather than just destroying the entire workshop. Cooling a forged sword in your own Youkai poison will still cool it as if with water but also imbue powerful toxins into the metal itself. You are able to add your abilities in creative ways to your creations without compromising them. Better still, you're very good at focusing what you create to not harm yourself. Using the bones of hundreds of hate-filled demons to create a cursed sword would direct those curses at your enemies, not at the original wielder of the sword. No need to worry about life draining demon blades if you're at the source of them all.


-Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse (Exalted - The Abyssals) (200CP)
        Much of the Underworld's economy rests on the production of soulsteel, one of the magical materials, which can only be produced by combining shavings from the walls of the Mouth of Oblivion with the melted corpus of a ghost. Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best smiths.
        Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel. First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking.
        Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith's hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords. Though you would need to delve deep into necromancy to put the latter into actual practise.


-Innate Talent: Magic item creator (Overlord - The Series) (200CP)
        You possess the good fortune to have an Innate Talent. Innate Talents are abilities that people are born with, and usually only one in two hundred people will actually have one. They can run the gamut of all sorts of things, though there is no certainty people will be born with an ability they will actually be able to make use of. For example someone born with an innate talent for learning magic doesn't actually help them find a magic teacher, and thus some innate talents may go to waste. Thankfully for you you can choose what Innate Talent you have from the following list. You possess the unheard of ability to have more than one Innate Talent, assuming you purchase more than one.
        You're really, unnaturally, good at making magic items. If you know how to make something then you can make it magical. Spoons, bowls, armor, books, weapons, toasters, anything. You actually have to know some magic in order to enchant items with a magical effect, and you don't gain any skills in actually making items, so if you want to make magic swords you'll have to learn some magic and then how to make regular swords first. You can copy down into scrolls any spell you know, which others can use to learn those spells (if they are capable of using that magic system and put in the time to study) or use them as one-use magic items. Additionally any magic item you create will be marginally better than it would have otherwise been, regardless of whatever abilities you might have brought with you from other worlds. You don't have to have this talent to make magic items or spell scrolls, but someone that does have this talent will always be much better than someone that doesn't.


-Magical Books (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (200CP)
        The art of spellcraft is one that requires an immense amount of dedication and in many ways talent as well. Learning new spells can take ages and this can easily drive many off or act as a massive constraint when time is of the essence. You've found a bit of a way around this conundrum, by imbuing a simple book with your understanding of the spellcraft you can create a magical item that when activated immediately passes this onto whoever activated it, though the book is consumed in the process. While this only applies to Elder Scrolls magic at first, you'll find that adapting it to other systems is an easy process and only requires that the process be fine tuned.


-Orb Alchemist (Timespinner) (200CP)
        The use of Aura is a key part of Viletean culture, and Orbs are an important tool in that regard. They act as focuses for Aura, allowing for standard and empowered effects, compared to what someone could accomplish on their own. You have the knowledge and skills to be able to craft these Orbs, or similar magical focuses. It will generally take materials such as gold, silver, gemstones, or other magically conductive materials. You can also improve these orbs using bits of crystallized Aura in the form of elemental beads, or using similar materials you can discover in future Jumps.


-Origami Witch( Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (200CP)
        A simple art turned deadly in your hands. Years of experience in folding paper has certainly made you a master at creating even the most complex origami shapes, your skill growing to the point that it began to mix with your magical energy, turning into something much more dangerous. You can easily use magic to shape paper into a wide variety of forms, imbued with varying effects. Creating origami familiars from paper, dangerous enough to scythe through human soldiers, is a ground-level effect. Creating powerful shields from overlapping paper flowers, flight through origami wings, patterns that strengthen existing spells or apply curse-like debuffs to those pierced by the paper cranes are all possible. While your main skill lies with direct paper spells, you will also find it much more possible to place magical effects onto paper for use with your magic. Researching some form of Onmyoudo or runic spells could prove especially potent.


-Photomirroring (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (200CP)
        Every Gishki wields their own Aquamirror. But these artifacts are mere replicas of the true Aquamirror, much weaker and limited than the original, even if they still function as potent foci for ritual magics. While the true Aquamirror still eludes you, you've become an accomplished crafter, and can easily replicate all sorts of magical artifacts in much weaker forms. I wouldn't be surprised if a portion of the Gishki currently active are actually wielding copies made by you instead of Noellia. Still, it's gonna take a lot more than this to improve on your copied designs, or even just make them easier to wield.


-Relay Artisan (Age of Wonders ll) (200CP)
        The knowledge necessary to create the massive structures known as 'Wizard Towers' is not easy to learn, but not especially rare either. Indeed, all Wizards rely on these towers for their abilities - in particular the ability to vastly increase the reach of their magics by channeling their arcane power through gigantic crystalline projectors lining the tower's structure. Smaller, less powerful crystals are occasionally used as well, both as 'Magic Relay' structures at fixed locations and with special equipment used by champions of the various armies. You are a gifted artificer when it comes to creating such relays and projectors. Not only can you create such crystals, but you have mastered the magical theories behind their function to the point you could craft these magical artifacts from other materials such as wood or silver. As your skill increases you'll be able to create more intricate and efficient relays, reducing their size or increasing their range. With practice, you could craft gemstones small enough for a ring's jewel that could let you project your magic within a dozen miles of their location. Once attuned, the connection between a Wizard and the relays you craft cannot be broken, it will continue to function across any distance and even across dimensions so long as the relay remains intact.


-Relic Magic (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (200CP)
        Much like amulets, relics are permanent objects that can be imbued with mystical effects. Unlike amulets, relics can be magical automatons or objects crafted to follow a soul into the underworld. Any relic crafted is bound to a single person when crafted and only functions for them. Relics can be as simple as a small model of a house that exists in full size within the underworld, small animated statues, or as complex as large guards and soldiers carved of stone, or even a special statue designed to allow a Mummy in the underworld to inhabit and interact with the living world.


-Rune Carving (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (200CP)
        Necrotects themselves are usually inexperienced in the ways of magic. It's rarely their duty to cast spells or command rituals, yet they are often called upon to inscribe runes on a vast scale or otherwise prepare things for magical means. You're very skilled at creating structures or items that can be channelled or used with magic, even whilst lacking it yourself. If you had a mage or wizard on hand, you'd even be able to work in tandem effortlessly, crafting items or structures suited to that person's magic in particular, working even better for them than anyone else.


-Soul Shards (Minecraft) (200CP)
        You know the dark arts needed to create a Soul Shard, which will eagerly devour the souls of those you slay. With enough of the souls of a given kind of creature, you'll be able to set up a Monster Spawner, which can release these souls as an endless wave of hostile creatures, ready to be slain and harvested (or perhaps unleashed upon your enemies). Alternatively, you might employ the Soul Forge to use these souls to create sinister Corrupted Iron, used to create foul equipment empowered by those you've slain.


-Upsized (Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath) (200CP)
        While making gems the size of entire buildings is possible for normal wizards, they usually don't bother, since they have a tendency to cause widespread devastation when they break, and that can endanger the wizard that cast the spells. If you don't mind working around the potentially deadly consequences of summoning huge gems, this perk will give you the skills necessary to scale your gems as large as you want, so long as the entire thing can fit within your spellcasting range. Of course, you will draw a lot of attention doing this.


-Wandmaker (Starbound) (200CP)
        There is more to life than just technology. You have mastered the mysterious process of binding elemental phenomena to seemingly harmless wands and staves, allowing those that use them to summon up fire or ice or acid or other stranger effects. With practice, the power of the effects your wands and staves can create will grow, and you could even manage to bind multiple effects to a single weapon.


-Artifice (Avernum) (300CP)
        You have a gift for the creation of powerful magical items. As True Artifacts their magic won't ever run out, or at the very least won't run out for a very long time. What you can make is limited to your knowledge, your imagination, and your resources.


-Crafting (Geneforge) (300CP)
        There are various things that can only be created through the use of essence and hard work. Shaped equipment, puresteel, certain complicated tools and devices, and certain materials used in enchanting. You can work all of them, producing high quality goods from basic ore and hard work.


-Key of Artifice | Grand Artificer (Lords of the Night Liches) (300CP)
        Key of Artifice (200CP)
        Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifice, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. The Key of Artifice allows liches who practice it to form a sort of reserve of artifice energy inside themselves that they can invest into items to create various Arcane tools. The amount of energy they can invest grows with each rank, but is fixed. They must recover the invested Artifice energy if they want to reinvest it in a new item. Normally it's somewhat annoying to reclaim energy from an item you don't have control of, but because you bought it as a perk, you may freely reclaim it at any time. Actually investing Artifice energy requires enchantment work and spending three parts Arcane energy for every bit of Artifice invested. A lich gains the ability to make items in this order -
        Arcane Focus: An Arcane Focus can have a number of abilities depending on the amount of Artifice invested in it, and how those points are invested. Only the Lich who makes it can use it. It can store Arcane, though it's not as efficient as an Arcane Crystal. It can be made to regenerate Arcane on its own for a somewhat high cost in Artifice. It can be made into a tool that can hold spells for you. It can make your spells deal greater damage. It can make it easier to use Sorcerae. It can help maintain Arcana for you with a phantom mind. It can help protect you from the threat of insanity from overusing Arcana - though unless you take certain disadvantages, you're already protected. It can have any other reasonable power that is in line with these.
        Arcane Crystal: These crystals can hold Arcane Energy, and are easy to move energy into and out of. No other function, but they are more cost effective for the amount stored then a Focus. They're made from precious gems, with the more precious the gem, the better a focus it can make. A simple one is in the 10 gp range, while the greatest ones are crystals worth 500 gp. Since you purchased this perk, it's possible for you to potentially use exotic / rarer / more expensive gems, but such would require research on your part.
        Occularum: An Occularum is a kind of immaterial drone used as a spy or seeker. Appearing as inky globes of misty darkness about two feet across, their shape seems to hint at being a giant eye. They usually remain on the Spectral Plane, only called when needed. Even when called forth, they are immaterial presences, hiding in the folds between the Material and the Spectral plane. Made of the substance of thought and imagination, they can slip through the tiniest crack even in substances that can block the immaterial. They can't really be damaged, though they can be stopped by forces that guard against immaterial and extra-dimensional intrusions. While on the Material Plane, it will see into both the Material and Spectral planes at the same time. It can clearly see for a mile on the Material, though it has ten times the range of vision on the Spectral plane. It has all the same vision modes you have, and you can use any spell to detect or see things through it. They always have Darkvision, Arcane Sight, and Detect Magic active. Your Arcane rank determines how well they can perceive and notice things, with the higher your rank the better their perception, easily reaching into the superhuman range by the 2nd or 3rd rank. They fly at about twice the speed of a normal human running, with perfect mobility. They require a moderate amount of Arcane to create, and no investment of your Artifice potential. You can have a number of them in existence at the same time based on your Intelligence. You can call one down anywhere on the same plane of existence as you, though you need some way of targeting the landing, of which you know several methods. Finally they can follow simple instructions on their own, and can 'contact' you for clarification, or you can actively control them, and they're well suited to searches or as sentinels.
        Greater Phylactery: An Arcane Lich who has achieved the penultimate technique of Artifice can create a Bound Phylactery, a greater form of Phylactery. There are many advantages to a Greater Phylactery. The first advantage is that they are far tougher than a normal Phylactery. You are always aware of where it is, as long as it's on the same plane as you. If it isn't, you're aware of what plane it is on. You always know when it's been touched by another being, and when it's taken damage. You can spend a trivial amount of Arcane to see the area around your Phylactery, and maintain that vision as long as you concentrate. Your Phylactery can also store up to six motes of Arcane energy, and regenerates a single one each day. You must be able to touch it to draw on that Arcane. You may also set up to six spells upon your Phylactery to trigger on contingencies you define. If they activate dangerous damaging spells, your Phylactery won't be harmed. You can hang six spells inside your Phylactery to draw upon when you need them. You don't need to be touching it to draw upon them, but it does take a moment of concentration. Creating a Greater Phylactery ties up an entire Rank's worth of Artifice Points.
        Bound Phylactery: The most ambitious liches won't be satisfied with a 'mere' Greater Phylactery. A bound phylactery isn't an object, it's a place. A house on chicken legs, an undersea palace of impossible geometries, a mountain. It takes physical work through the entire structure to be bound, and an investment of resources directly proportional to the volume being bound, but there is no limit on size. In return, a Lich can bind themselves to something that isn't carried so much as lived within. Here are some common properties that show up in most Bound Phylacteries.
        * You can see from anywhere on or in it, as if you were standing there.
        * You can teleport to any part of it for a modest cost in Arcane. You can be perfectly accurate with the spell as long as the destination is within or on it.
        * You can cast spells through it, as if you were there.
        * You can manipulate space and dimensions inside and around it.
        * You can make it shift and cause parts of it to move. If it's built correctly, you can make it walk la Baba Yaga's hut or Howl's Moving Castle.
        * You know everyone who is in contact with it, and where they are.
        * It regenerates at 5% of its total 'health' per day if damaged, and you can speed it up massively by meditating on making it fix itself.
        Bound Phylacteries are grand works of Artifice, and they tend to have unique properties in addition to these. It binds two whole ranks worth of Artifice points to make a Bound Phylactery. In addition to those more permanent constructions, Liches with the Arcana of Artifice also learn the technique of Arcane Enhancement. This essentially lets the lich turn prepared objects into enchanted objects with a temporary enhancement based on your Arcane State. As you bought this as a perk, you can always treat it as the final Arcane state (Spectral Lich), for an enhancement bonus of six on the item. You don't have to use the full bonus, as the higher bonus you use the more expensive in Arcane it gets. Such tools are Arcane weapons or armor. The Arcane Trait makes them especially good against the forces of the Void. In future worlds, it will work against forces of unmaking, oblivion, and the like, as well as undead in general. Weapons with the Arcane trait ignore defenses and immunities. Armor is stronger and helps you resist magical attacks. Other items are harder for forces of the void to resist. Who knows what incredible things you'll to make as your mastery of Artifice continues to grow?
        Grand Artificer (100CP)
        While every artificer will continue to grow in the amount of Artifice they can keep invested, your growth is doubled here. More than that, you find you can permanently empower things, freeing you from having to maintain an ongoing investment. It takes a fifty-to-one ratio of Arcane to Artifice to replace the Artifice investment, and you can't empower something beyond your theoretical maximum Artifice - how much you could invest if all of it was available for you to use at one time. Using this, it's possible to make Arcane Foci that other people can use. As long as all the investment is permanent investment paid in Arcane, then you can set criteria for who or what can use it. Note that there aren't a lot of limits on what an Arcane Foci can do. You can also make an Arcane Enhancement permanent. It requires ten times as much Arcane to make it permanent as temporary. Such enhancement overlaps with standard enchantment, but does count as the required '+1' needed before other special abilities might be added, and an item so enhanced is considered an Arcane Enchantment for the purposes of ignoring anti-magic and spells. Yes, you can make an item a permanent Arcana Foci with interesting abilities, make it permanently Arcane Enhanced, and then enchant it. Something like that is basically a minor artifact though, and represents a huge investment of time and effort, without other perks.


-Key of Golems | Unliving Soldiers (Lords of the Night - Liches) (300CP)
        Key of Golems (200CP)
        Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Golems, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. Golems are a common tool for the Liches of the Guild of Wizards. The greatest are the semi-real Artifex Golems of the Order of Artifex, but making them is hardly limited to just those master craftsman. The common Arcane Golem is created from a Heart. These Golem Hearts are crafted from precious stones and metals, growing increasingly grand for more impressive Golem Hearts, and then they're empowered with an investment of energy. A lich may temporarily invest part of their Permanent Arcane, tying it up in the empowerment of the heart. They can reclaim that investment at any time, but the heart will break and must be crafted anew. Alternatively, if the Lich also practices the Arcana of Artifice, they may instead invest Artifice into empowering a Heart.
        A lich may only have a limited number of hearts in existence at once, restricted by the height of their Intelligence. Once empowered, a golem heart is very similar to a Occularum, though unlike those devices it has no sense of its own. Instead, it can bind its now immaterial essence to a piece of the world, and reshape that piece into a Golem. Such crude golems might be relatively weak on their own, but can channel a shadow of their makers might and skill. If destroyed, the Heart is dissipated from reality into potentiality for a time, but will reform after a day. It's also possible to build prepared vessels for the Golem Heart. Such vessels are far stronger than an ad-hoc animation, and the destruction of such a vessel will not dissipate the Golem Heart, letting it jump to a new vessel immediately. That strength though comes at the cost of, well, cost. Resources and time and effort to craft such. A Crystal Golem for example may be a juggernaut, but it's also a ten foot tall statue made of diamond and platinum. Making it costs. Obviously you are not limited to just Crystal Golems, and can use other materials you have access to, with more powerful and exotic materials tending to result in more powerful and exotic golems. With effort even things like the mighty and near indestructible Adamantium Golem may be in your reach. You may see out of the eyes of your Golems (or roughly where their head is, should they not have eyes), and project your mind into them to control them directly. They can obey simple orders and routines, and make fine guards and wardens, if unimaginative ones.
        Unliving Soldiers (100CP)
        Your Golem Hearts aren't LIKE Occularum. They are an extra set of Occularum, with all the abilities of one. Even when invested in matter, the Occularum part keeps watch around its golem, seeing and spying. They also gain real, if unimaginative, intelligence. They're as smart as a somewhat dumb mortal, but they're perfectly logical and throurogh, and they feel no emotions that would make them perform badly. In the end, they're surprisingly good at working around their limitations. They also reform in only six hours, and they're better at animating their bodies than normal golem hearts. They might have the same basic attributes, but their reflexes and skill at using those attributes is improved. Occularum abilities are described in the Key Of Artifice perk. Should you also possess the upgraded Key Of Artifice perk you may make these Occularum Golem Hearts without a permanent investiture of Arcane or Artifice energy, though it does still require an expenditure of such energies during the initial creation.


-Soul Smith (Dark Souls) (300CP)
        Well for one, this makes you a pretty good blacksmith with an emphasis on repair, able to repair most normal weapons, armor and trinkets with the right materials and a bit of time. You're also pretty good at forging and upgrading normal weapons and armor. There is more to this craft than you would first think, as Smiths in this world are capable of several unique acts. In this land, smiths can use special stones to imbue weapons with various types of power, such as Fire or Lightning, during the forging process. Given enough time and practice, they can even forge powerful souls into their handiwork to create unique and often times powerful equipment. While this skill doesn't make you the best in the world at this craft, it gives you a solid foundation with room to improve.


-Spirit Painting (Earth Girls) (300CP)
        Your paintings and artwork catch a little piece of their subject's soul in them. This isn't harmful at all in itself. This link between the subject and the artwork might have all sorts of effects. Someone whose picture you paint on a cave wall might always find their way back to it, painting a couple together might make their relationship long-lasting and happy, or painting big-tooths and boars might attract those animals to your village's hunting grounds.


-Talisman Adept (Inukami) (300CP)
        You are very skilled at using talismans. What that means is you can make them have different properties (like light or sound) and with enough time and training you can make truly devastating effects. You are much better at using talismans and can give them properties of what shape they are in. Shaped like a frog? These talismans can bounce towards their intended target.


-That Undefinable Thing (Tales of Symphonia) (300CP)
        Even if you can't describe it, you can still manipulate it. You can now make physical tools and containers for souls, as well as gaining the knowledge of how to use the soul as a power source for magic, machinery, and living bodies. Given proper resources (raw souls), you can create Exspheres and Key Crests which can then power the things mentioned in your place. Anything powered by their user's soul is known intimately to them, inhabited by the soul the same way a body is inhabited by a soul. It becomes in all ways an extension of the self, for good or ill. While the soul is infinite, it can be diminished and grown. Take care.


-The Arcane Craft (Sword and Sorcery) (300CP)
        As much as you might look down upon brutes and barbarians who know only how to break bone and spill blood, you and the warriors of this land have one thing in common. You require the tools of your trade. You know all the methods and ways to bind arcane and mysterious forces into physical vessels. Rings, staves, talismans, warded stone towers, and even more. These items allow the channeling of such forces to work your will, capturing, bending, and shaping the worlds invisible tides to enable works of sorcery and occult splendor. The strength of these items and their effects rely on your skill, knowledge, and power. Of course should you yourself be a font of such forces from your varied lives then you would be surely capable of building the focuses and talismans to augment and amplify your power. The world rewards men for diligent labor. It would behoove you to refine this art to get everything you can out of it. This also includes the skill to use such items, even those not made by your hand should you have the ability to reveal their secrets.


-Ars Magus Creation | Armagus Creation (Blazblue) (400CP)
        Ars Magus Creation (100CP)
        You have basic education in the creation and modification of Ars Magus. You understand how they work and how to create non-combat Grimoires, though you require time and resources in order to do so.
        Armagus Creation (300CP)
        ! requires Ars Magus Creation! You have advanced education in the creation and modification of Ars Armagus. Armagus on the whole are dangerous and unstable weapons if they're used by someone who doesn't know what they're doing, and creating them is no less dangerous because even one glimpse into the Boundary is enough to shred a man's sanity permanently. However, anything you make will invariably be better than anything you can buy in a store or on the black market.


-Artificer (Twokinds) (400CP)
        Of course, plenty of people will pay serious coin for self-contained magic. You now have the skill to build magical artifacts and constructs. These items can replicate any spell you are capable of casting, so long as they are supplied with sufficient mana. More powerful artifacts will require more expensive materials and longer construction times, but the demand for reliable, consistent spellworks exists in every community on Mekkan. Whether you make these devices for yourself or for others, your devices are only limited by your access to materials and arcane knowledge. If you have the Natural Remedies perk, you may now brew potions that confer spell effects. Whether you bottle an Invisibility spell or cook up a cauldron of Cat's Grace, your spells now come in a convenient liquid package.


-Artisan of Moonsilver (Exalted - The Lunars) (400CP)
        While their tattoos are perhaps the most important artifacts any Lunar will ever bear, they are not the only artifacts in use by the Lunar Exalted. Not by a long shot. Many wonders have forged of the protean metal that is Moonsilver, exploiting the full potential of this mutable metal. These items are invaluable for the Children of the Moon, for they can change shape along with their owners. Indeed, many older Chosen of the Moon regard the use of moonsilver as the exclusive right of their kind. These elders tend to take a dim view of anyone else possessing moonsilver artifacts and may seize such items for themselves or to pass on to young Lunar protgs. Still, many young Lunars find they will have to create their own panoplies, for their elders often hoard these artifacts to themselves. It is a good thing then, that you are an exceptionally talented artisan, a master in all the mundane crafts and even further genius at working the mercurial Moonsilver that responds best to you. You have been granted the secrets of creating artifacts from that changeable metal, as well as how to make mundane armor into the Moon-Faced Mail that likewise shifts to fit whatever form you are currently wearing. Even the most important technique of the No Moons is known to you, the Form-Fixing Method that binds the moonsilver tattoos to the body of newly reincarnated Lunars.


-Celestial Technology (Darksiders) (400CP)
        Though they are not makers, the angels are a force of creation. this perk grants you their knowledge in supernatural technology they use. Holy armor, lances that shoot beams of light and all manner of technology that repels darkness and creatures of evil. You also become more skilled in the use of holy weapons.


-Creator | Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (Lords of the Night - Liches) (400CP)
        Creator (400CP)
        People focus on the grand secrets, the sublime arts, the intricate techniques of the Arcane. And all of these things exist. But before them all, the truth of the Arcane is simple. It is the Fire of Creation, the Spark that flares into the infinite possibilities of existence. It is a force of Making, and you are utterly in tune with that aspect. When you use Sorcerae to Create something permanently, it only costs two times as much as it does for a transitory thing instead of the ten times it would take normally and such works always have a grace to them that makes them subtly better than they should be, and if you could succeed at such a Sorcerae, you will do so with grace and panache. You might call it a 'natural 20.'
        Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (0CP) - See text in Tower of Sorcerae


-Crystal Metallurgy (Final Fantasy XIV) (400CP)
        You figure that it would only be a matter of time until somebody attempted to forge a suit of armor out of crystal. Frankly, with the materials available and the tools there, it's more of a surprise that it hasn't happened already. Of course when you actually try it, you'll realize why -the magic surrounding the crystals is simply too strong to be forged using traditional means. But if traditional means won't work, that just tells you that you need to employ more esoteric means of forging. Forging not with traditional fire, but with the concentrated essence of Aether and fire crystals, you can bring to life a suit of armor with crystal alone -retaining its Aether collecting properties, and magnifying the effects of spells all around it. Perhaps with time, you might be able to make golems with this


-Demon-Smith (Dota 2) (400CP)
        Many demons have had centuries to refine their skill at crafting, and despite the mortal assumption that your kind is only good for destruction, you've also learned to create great weapons. You are able to use complex crafting techniques capable of granting a simple steel blade an edge sharper than should be physically possible, but you've also learned to imbue your foul energies into that which you create. You begin by attempting to create an axe, and as the process goes on, you find it growing bone-like spikes and a gem on its guard which exudes a terrible malevolence. That its edge cuts the soul as much as it does the flesh is almost an afterthought once you wield it in battle and find yourself with an unnatural lifeforce that sees your wounds slowly mending even as you fight. You try to forge a weapon of two conflicting natures, and your own hateful being serves as a buffer that forces the entire thing to stay together despite it quite literally desiring to be sundered. The results are certain to be as varied as they are powerful, and you may learn to use this same corrupting technique with any other energies you may have. Keep in mind that you are literally pouring a portion of yourself into your work before you try to outfit an army. Hahsh Izh omoz, groth hollom chron voth icha Izh.


-Doors that lead elsewhere (Dungeon Keeper) (400CP)
        Magically speaking, here and there are rather relative concepts, so why not take the easy route and build a dungeon that's here, there, and a little bit of somewhere else? While one cannot breach hellish boundaries with mere stonework, an auspicious floorplan can evoke the environments of other worlds through well-established principles of magical sympathy. If built precisely, the barriers between dimensions can become thin indeed within your dungeon, making summoning, teleportation and other exercises in dimensional manipulation almost effortless...and much more hazardous for your enemies, their own such spells at the risk of going awry in the worst ways and possibly drawing the ire of things best left undisturbed.


-Fairy (Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon) (400CP)
        Despite having human parents, you are a long way from being human yourself. An ancient, long buried heritage in your ancestry has awakened and you were born as a Fairy. A Fairy is an extension of Gaia, similar to how the hairs or fingers on your body are an extension of you. Despite this, you retain your free will completely, thus allowing you to benefit quite significantly from being considered a natural part of the world, especially when it comes to your magecraft being accepted as entirely natural. You are also able to become invisible to the senses of any being without magic.
        Beyond this, you have amazing talent in creating magic items and while you are right now a long way from crafting something like Excalibur or Arondight, you are still several times as skilled, fast and efficient in the creation of magical items as normal. Lastly, you have the potential, with enough power and/or age, to evolve into a full fledged Elemental, granting you greater authority and importance to the world, along with a not insignificant boost in power.
        In future worlds, you may choose to have a similar connection to the world you begin on as you do with Gaia here.


-Fangs of the Beast (Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows) (400CP)
        The greatest of warriors only become such with the greatest of tools, which themselves must be made from the greatest of materials. What greater materials could there be than those legendary finds at the end of quests, the mythical beasts that heroes slay or even the bodies of the hero himself? You are a master at the creation of all kinds of magical weapons, armour and items, capable of crafting even things like some of the magical spears wielded by the Knights of the Red Branch.
        Your proper talents come to the fore when making items from the body parts of slain monsters or magical beings, allowing you to not only create results of far higher quality than normal but also to retain some or all of the magical powers inherent to the being you are using as materials.


-Fragmentation (D.Y.N. Freaks) (400CP)
        The knowledge and process of creating Fragments has come into your possession. You're now able to turn individual or small, themed groups of your own powers or abilities into magical objects that allow other people to use those powers, bonding to the items, though you cannot make more than one Fragment for any given power. Though you can take these objects back at any time, those other than the bonded partner will find it very difficult to take out or even use the newly made Fragment. If you wish, you may make the Fragment slowly corrupt the user as they use more and more of its power, to the point that they eventually become either a beast or a mental and cosmetic copy of yourself, though they only possess the power you gave in the Fragment. Finally, you are able to moderate how much of the power you put into a Fragment that is able to be used, though you must still put the entire power in.


-Grousing Gadgeteer (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (400CP)
        Like Ghastly Bespoke, Kenspeckle Grouse, and Doctor Rote all rolled into one, you have immense talent when it comes to the creation of all varieties of enchanted or magical items. Whether it's Ghastly's protective clothing, woven razor Cleaver scythes, a magical prison like the Cube, Kenspeckle Grouse's life-annihilating Desolation Engine, sentient magical machines like the Engineer, or even the magic-boosting Accelerator itself, you have the skills needed to create them. More powerful creations like the Cube and the Accelerator will certainly take more time, resources, and experimentation to fully develop, of course.


-Infusion (JoJo) (400CP)
        Besides infusing your body with Ripple, you can now direct the flow of energy at will. This will lead to a variety of effects, such as using Ripple to mend an ally's wounds. As well, you can infuse Ripple into objects. This improves existing qualities and makes them deadly to the undead and living alike.


-Jadework (World of Darkness - Kindred of the East) (400CP)
        The Green Courts are so named because of the vast stores of jade, which is bought and sold for great sums of money, political favors or whatever else that the vampires need. It can be worked into powerful talismans and used to store chi, so it definitely has its uses. You've acquired the skill needed to make many (though not all) of the talismans, and could easily learn more. Jade, as you might already know, is valuable to Shen for many reasons, not the least of which its use in various rites and chi storage. You've got the connections you need to buy and sell, but raw materials are hard to come by these days. In other worlds, this could be applied to similarly rarified and functional materials, particularly gems or those used for or by Shen.


-Legacy (Ravenwood) (400CP)
        In this strange plane of existence, things sometimes take on traits they were never meant to take, a spark of something greater. You gain the ability to imbue a spark within an object, even immaterial ones such as songs, that allow it to build up, or awaken, a legacy. If such an item is used for a feat, it will gain a property based on that feat. A pair of boots used to run the length of a country to bring important news may gain a property to increase the speed of the one wearing them in some minor way. A shield used to block the fire breath of a dragon may develop the power to resist flames, and impart that resistance to its wielder. Even simply using the item for its intended purpose will make it ever so slightly better for that purpose, such as a sword growing sharper or armor growing more durable, though it could take years to accumulate a noticeable effect in this way. These legacy abilities may be fairly weak on their own, but they stack up over time, with greater feats giving greater improvements (Note: You are not required to perform said feats. Anyone using the item may build on the legacy abilities). Using this ability on an item that has already accomplished great feats grants these same abilities, only stronger based on the time since those feats were performed, retroactively.


-Legends In The Making (Dota 2) (400CP)
        Many are content to find great artifacts with long and adored stories, but you've discovered the secret to creating them entirely. First, you have a modicum of crafting skill in nearly all areas. Swords, bows, armor, jewelry, while you're nothing to speak about you get the job done. However, sell a sword to a strapping young lad. Now sell a shield to some mercenary desperate to make more of his life after the boy dies, then sell a bow to some look. It might take a while, but you're going to make something for someone made of sterner stuff than most at some point, and that's when your craftsmanship shines. A knight using an armor crafted by yours truly slays a dragon despite being bathed in fire, then finds his armor having a design resembling scales once it cools down. Then, he discovers his armor quite literally drinks fire, heating up to harm nearby enemies while leaving him cool as a breeze. A ranger using a bow made by you shoots a monstrous avian in the wing from an absurdly long distance, and now any arrows fired from said bow home in on its target's weak points, seeking to cripple them. So it is, that when legendary Heroes are born, so are legendary implements. Curiously, those supernatural tools you inadvertently create always return to you, seemingly desiring for you to grant them new wielders. I'm sure you can figure out how to profit from this.


-Material Hybridization (Final Fantasy XIV) (400CP)
        Hybrid materials are the newest and hippest thing to come to Eorzea, since the presence of stolen Garlean magitek technology showed up. Now Alchemists all over Eorzea have been experimenting with this stolen technology, trying to reverse engineer the material and fundamentals behind the creation of such things. A worthy venture, and one from which you've perfected the art of making hybrid materials. Not a matter of making alloys, but making ores and fabrics enchanted with the elements, creating resources fundamentally tied with the Aether. firemetal, watermetal, the hybridization is limited only by the complexity of the element, and the nature of the material. You can't expect to succeed every time, but you'll never succeed if you don't try.


-Moonsilver Smith (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (400CP)
        Not only have you been trained by some of your tribe's best silversmiths you have a talent for crafting silver that goes beyond mere mortal. Not only is it easier to talk a spirit into inhabiting your creations, any silver weapon you create never dulls or breaks in battle. They also deal twice the damage to any creature vulnerable to silver. Outside of this jump, supernatural creatures that take damage from your silver weapons are wounded as if they are vulnerable to silver.


-Pocket Master (Luck of the Draw) (400CP)
        You have a rather interesting talent for building 'small' pocket dimensions. The more power you have when creating the dimension the more you can customize it, making it larger, move at different rates of time or have strange and or interesting effects like a wall of mist around the edges that allows you to walk into and out of on the opposite side of the pocket dimension. With enough practice, you could even include aspects of the world of dreams in your dimensions.


-Providence (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1) (400CP)
        Ah, what an interesting trick. There is far more power in your body than one might expect. Quite literally, actually. When you give away part of your body willingly, the part so removed becomes akin to a magic item, holding supernatural abilities appropriate to the relevant part and your own wishes at the time of creation. Perhaps a cut of your mane large enough to use as a cloak could grant another your durability, or a scale from your legs could be used to grant them your speed. Of course, having more esoteric abilities will let you grant more esoteric effects. A fang capable of shattering enemy spells, or perhaps a claw capable of shooting beams of force when wielded like a sword? I won't presume to know everything you're capable of. Still, these items can't last forever, and every use of them will bring them closer to the breaking point. Equipping someone before they go on a monthslong journey is well within the cards, but I would not hope to stockpile these if I were you. The lingering will left inside those magic items will also make sure they can not be used in ways you'd disapprove of, as well.


-Pylonist (Terraria - Journey's End) (400CP)
        The Pylons are special devices that ordinarily require the presence of several people living around them to be used, and can only be bought from someone living in an area. Now, however, when you spend a bit of time within a given 'biome', you gain knowledge of how to make a special stand out of materials found within that 'biome'. Once properly constructed and placed within the biome, a glowing crystal will appear in the air above the stand. You are able to instantly teleport to any such Pylon that you have constructed, and you can allow others who touch a Pylon to use them as well. You are only able to teleport to Pylons that are on or near the same planet as you, and only one Pylon can be constructed per 'biome type' on a given planet. That said, you can leave the planet and return and the Pylons will still be there.


-The Science of the Soul (The Games We Play) (400CP)
        The human soul is the oldest and most mysterious subject discussed by man. In this world, its existence is a proven fact, and anything that exists can be subjected to the pitiless processes of science. Like the Angels of ancient Babel, you are greatly skilled in the study and understanding of the soul, be it humans, animals or stranger. Just as someone would test and interact with chemicals or bodies or metals or whatever, you find yourself capable of designing devices and methods that can interact with souls, and things like them on the same level. You can measure them, diagnose them, operate on them and do pretty much anything else you can imagine to them. With time and some research, you might even be able to construct your own custom made souls from free Sephirot like the Angels once did, perhaps even custom designing it's abilities in the far future.


-Unlocking the Soul (Dark Souls 2) (400CP)
        Perhaps you have more ambition than just bestowing the mundane with mystical power. You aim for higher, you aim to transmute the power of souls into tools to be manipulated by your hand. Was I correct? Then look no further. You have been bestowed skills and abilities that allow you to transform souls and spiritual power into a variety of ways. The most basic is using weaker souls, and crystallizing them into Lifegems, objects that can mend and repair flesh when broken in hand. The basic is just an example however, but a good one. Crystallizing souls, making their essence physical and widening the potential to interact with them. With such abilities, powerful souls can be transformed into weapons and trinkets, or golems powered by batteries made of souls.


-Writ of Worlds (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
        All things that enter under the influence of the Sphere of Speech dissolve into whispering glyphs that hang upon the air, writings that spell out their own identities and qualities in the numberless languages that are Elloge. Within her inner realms perception and travel are difficult for intruders hailing from conventionally physical realms, requiring them to acclimate themselves to formless aural or textual existence so that they might explore the peculiar volumes of her inner spaces. Drawing upon some of her power, you may spell out the identities and qualities of those things you would like to create. Instead of physical means you may use your own writings to create objects of symbolic reality defined by the whispering glyphs. Forge swords of biting retorts, traps of erotic expressions like barbed hooks, cryptic devices, winding paths of efflorescent prose, and even living beings like savage packs of itinerant paradoxes and koans. All these may be created by you, even if the creation of permanent literature requires the same care that the forging of artifacts would, lest they reach the end of their narratives after some time in an unwritten world.


-Mo Weapon Master | Holy Mo Forging Pool (World of Cultivation) (500CP)
        Mo Weapon Master (200CP)
        The way the Mo forge their weapons is unique from how Xiuzhe create their talismans. Through the process of forging already high class materials the Mo forging method focuses far less on creating a weapon with specific new traits, and focuses far more on emphasising and enhancing the properties which already exist in the materials by forging them in the deep cold flowing waters of the Mo Forging Pools.
        You are now a master Mo Weaponsmith, able to look at a pile of materials and bring out the absolute best of what they could be, enhancing the traits they would naturally have if you forged them. A dagger forged from a beast which breathed fire will have a fiery aura, or even possibly burn upon touch of the blade, while more complex things such as a sword made from the tongue of a rotten undead carp soaked in the water of a necrotic realm may be able to cause things in a small area to decompose. Through hard work and study you can do much with this art, and should you have other means of forging or creating weapons the results will only grow more impressive. Also comes with the knowledge of how to create a Mo Weapon Forging Pool.
        Holy Mo Forging Pool (300CP)
        The Underground Nether River is silent, it is 60 feet wide and spectacular to see. The river water of the Underground Nether River is as sticky as glue, is black yet clear, and flows without making a sound. The water in this river is extremely suitable for the creation of Mo Weapons, by placing a part of yourself or another creature as well as a weapon into the waters you can guide them to merge and create a Mo Weapon, a weapon connected to you much like a talisman or a flying sword, though often times more powerful, not because of superior forging techniques but because of the superior materials conglomerating to create a weapon.
        The pool has the special property to not only work well for forging Mo Weapons it also has the effect of combining multiple weapons or items into one, as Xiao Mo Ge did with his Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike. Doing this imbues all the powers of the items into one while allowing them to shift between the forms of up to ten of the items used in its creation. For example the Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike was a powerful Earth Mo Weapon created, but its real power came from its ability to shift into ten different weapons in an instant. Now you can create something similar.
        When used to forge with the parts of a creature it forges a better weapon depending on how strong the creature was and has minor affinities based on the creature and part used. For instance using the claw of a fire dragon will probably create a fire attributed Mo Weapon ranging between a dagger and a sword (considering how big the claw is). Though weapons created will be much more impressive if you have some training in forging already
        After the jump it can become a warehouse attachment should you wish it.


-Order of Artifex | Useless! | Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (Lords of the Night - Liches) (500CP)
        Order of Artifex (500CP)
You have gained the Mark of Artifex. Your body becomes more drawn out, thinner. Long delicate fingers, sunken eyes. You develop phantom ink and oil stains on your skin, if you still have skin. At the end of the Jump, these effects will become a template you may apply or remove as you wish. But that's just your body, the thing you probably care the least about. You are of the Artifex, the great Craftsman of the Guild of Wizards. The true mark isn't on your body, but the body that you make, your Artifex golem.
But that’s just your body, the thing you probably care the least about. You are of the Artifex, the great Craftsman of the Guild of Wizards. The true mark isn’t on your body, but the body that you make, your Artifex golem.


Artifex Golem
An Artifex golem is crafted from a ripped free fragment of your intellect, will, and force of personality, damaging you when it’s first created, though this damage will heal over time. It also requires an investment of the same while you manifest it, though that cost is covered by you buying this perk.
An Artifex Golem’s advancement is normally linked to your Arcane State, but yours grows independent of that. A new Artifex Lich normally creates a Golem slightly weaker than a Flesh Golem, while a Spectral Lich creates something the equal of an Anaxim. 
Artifex golems, being made of thought rather than matter can be summoned and dismissed with a thought, but can only exist near you. Normally this would be limited by your Arcane State, but as you paid for this, you have the maximum range, like a Spectral Lich. You can manifest or send your Golem up to 200 yards away. 
Your Artifex golem shares your resistances to damage. You may transfer health to and from your Golem. You may also meditate to heal your golem at a decent rate.


All Artifex Liches excel at crafts, just being better at them then they should be. You also receive half again as much Artifice as another lich. You are also slightly better at Sorcerae that conjures or creates things.
Lastly, you gain the Arcana of Artifex. You gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifex, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth.
Artifex allows you to enhance your projected Artifex Golem, giving it the essence of different materials to further strengthen it. Magically pure examples of that element are invested in the golem, which are expensive to acquire and can normally only be purchased in Kethak, though nothing stops you from sourcing your own should you have other methods, or experimenting with more exotic materials.
The possible enhancements are
● Quartz for Strength 
● Granite for Armor
● Mercury for Dexterity 
● Platinum to grant it fast healing. 
● Diamond to make it tougher and able to take more damage 
● Sapphire to give it a freezing aura and make its strikes bite with cold. Incompatible with Ruby. 
● Ruby to give it a burning aura and make its strikes burn with flame. Incompatible with Sapphire. 
● Adamantine to make it resist all damage from lesser sources.
While the initial enhancement is small, it can be grown by binding a piece of mind and intellect to further grow that enhancement, with a greater binding allowing for more enhancement, capped by the lich’s normal intelligence. 
It can be enhanced further with Arcane energy, capped by the lich’s rank of accomplishment in the Arcana of Artifex. Finally, since it’s made of thought, you can basically have it manifest looking however you might want it to look, and since it is (very) technically a form of summon after being made, any abilities you have that enhance summons will also work on it.
        Useless! (100CP)
You find that your Artifex Golem is greater than others of its kind. Even when manifested, it is corporeal or incorporeal as would be most advantageous at that moment. A telekinetic barrier of intent deflects away harm, greatly armoring it based on your intelligence. You also find that you don't need to invest mind and intellect to empower it through the Arcana of Artifex - the fragment of mind you've invested to create it will maintain its own enhancements. You may still further enhance it by pouring in Arcana, to push it to the absolute limit. If your golem is destroyed, you can quickly rebuild it, and the personal cost is lessened, so that it takes only hours to recover from creating your Golem.

-Advent of Aquamirror (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (600CP)
        As you know, the original Aquamirror once used to be the Mirror of the Ice Barrier, an artifact meant to control, suppress, and seal the three Dragons of the Ice Barrier. Through her own expertise, Noellia altered it into a tool for communication, hypnosis, and performing all kinds of rituals. While you might not necessarily have something worthy of your skills to use, you too have reached this level of prowess. Altering magical items to perform completely different functions is something you could do if given a mere month or two to study them. Simple tweaks, such as removing a fire scepter's ability to create fire to augment its ability to command fire, would require seconds at most. Actually improving an item is a lot more involved, and could take years of work to see any noticeable change, but is well within your capabilities, as is reverse engineering them outright.


-Artifact Savant (Marvel Magic) (600CP)
        Agomotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme of earth, created many wondrous things still in use all of these millennia later. Perhaps his most notable creation was that of the Three-Fold Path, a system of magic still in widespread use today. But also extremely important were the potent magical artifacts he created, many of which serve invaluable roles as badges of office for the Sorcerer Supreme and tools for the defense of all existence. You understand just how powerful and important such tools can be, for you yourself are a skilled and talented enchanter. You find that imbuing items with powers is a simple matter for you, overlaying nearly any spell or magical ability you know onto some item to more easily invoke it yourself or even to allow others to do so. Though you are not yet as skilled in the creation of such wonders as Agomotto, this may yet change in time. Perhaps you will even find a way to permanently imbue living beings with your magic to grant them great powers of their own.


-Blood Artisan Plus (Bloodborne) (600CP)
        You have been granted an experienced artisan's knowledge on crafting things out of blood. This is basically an overall improved version of Blood Artisan, allowing you to craft more potent Blood Vials, larger Blood Stones and even Blood Gems. Blood Gems are supernatural gems formed from blood that can be slotted into weapons to give them a variety of special abilities. Some Blood Gems can make an edge sharper, or a tip pointer. Other gems can bathe a weapon in fire, poison or electricity to make them more effective against certain enemies. Some gems can even increase your strength or dexterity while wielding the weapon it's slotted in. Their magical powers can be stacked, to an extent at least. This means you may slot up to three different Blood Gems in the same weapon, though no more. Blood Gems can be slotted and removed with special equipment.


-Code Creator (Fate/Zero) (600CP)
        Many Magi rarely move beyond their own field of focus when crafting items imbued with magical power. What reason would there be when they could simply pay for another Magi to make something if they absolutely needed it? You're one of these skilled experts that others come to. Obviously in your chosen field, you're one of the great masters in creating magical items, such that something like Volumen Hydrargyrum wouldn't be hard at all, but even when it comes to fields of magic you have no knowledge in at all you can get surprising results. So long as someone with the requisite knowledge is nearby and willing, you can draw on their knowledge of the subject as you work, effectively combining your skills with their knowledge to become a master craftsman in fields that you have no knowledge of.


-Forge Wyrm (Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons) (600CP)
        Dragons are often lazy creatures, sleeping away the centuries on great piles of wealth. But there are always exceptions. Some dragons choose instead to turn their minds to craftsmanship, and these can produce some of the greatest magical artifacts known to exist. Indeed, by combining your natural breath weapon, immense intellect, aptitude for magic, and a bit of either permanent investment of your own power or scavenged magic from other magical items, you may turn raw resources into any magical item known to exist, perhaps even artifacts who defy the known laws of magical items. This will, of course, take proportionately greater investments of effort and rare materials, yet to a dragon this is a lesser downside than it is to one of the shorter-lived races. Even so, for the greatest magical items it may be a long quest on its own to gather up the resources to even begin creating it. Of course, you will be able to find analogues to the raw resources in future worlds. You don't even need to work it directly with your own claws, for this comes with magic that can enable you to shape raw goods with exceptional precision and dexterity. Additionally, you are equally capable of leading entire teams in crafting projects at a time, perhaps organizing mindless golems or hired help.


-I Send My Sword (Highschool DxD) (600CP)
        Something many forget in this age is that it was the hand of God that created the Sacred Gears, and granted them to humans so that they may work miracles on the world. The secrets of this art died with Him, but the impact they leave on the world has echoed throughout time and history. You have gained a shadow of this art, with the ability to forge Holy Blades...not True Holy Blades, but powerful weapons that burn away the infernal and cut deeply against Devils or wicked creatures. More than that, you have a sense of others besides yourself who can shape the course of history if granted such a weapon, or any power you can pass to them, and a very accurate idea of how they will change the world around them for better or worse. All it will take is a mysterious, angelic figure granting them what they need when the moment calls for it. In time, you may be able to forge True Holy Blades after some trial and error, forging kin to legendary weapons such as Durandal and Excalibur.


-Item Construction EX (Fate Servant Supplement) (600CP)
        The Skill to manufacture magical items, from implements of war to items for daily use. The EX Rank represents something that falls outside of the numerical ranking scale, a value that cannot be quantified under the normal system because it is in a league of its own, powerful to the extent of rendering comparisons meaningless. (Descriptions taken from the Type-Moon wiki.) You have the knowledge and skill to build things rivaling anything seen in the Fate franchise.
        EX: Able to make healing potions that grant true immortality, craft Kaleidosticks and other world altering artifacts.
        A: Capable of making healing potions that grant limited immortality.
        B: Production of devices that carry magic power.


-Jumper Crystals (Date a Live) (600CP)
        The power that allowed the First Spirit to create the subsequent ones, or rather, a more refined version of the same process. By gathering enough mana and concentrating over a particular power or ability you possess, a small crystal can be made. These crystals can be given to others to allow them use the power you copied in there. While these won't convert the user into a mad monster (like the original ones), the process is still unfinished, and could alter the user a little (as partial memory loss) if their mind isn't strong enough. You can perfect the process, though it would take some time and research.


-Labyrinth Creation (Fate/Extra) (600CP)
        The Moon Cell creates entire Reality Marbles to simulate each area in the Grail War, including the Lunar Seas where Servant Battles take place. While you're not able to replicate this incredible feat, you can being to create Lunar Sea like pockets of your own. While you can always decide the general theme to the dungeon and it's enemies, at first, these will be small dungeons, perhaps only a dozen rooms and connecting hallways, and filled with weak fodder that will only drop cheap items. As you grow more experienced, all these parameters will expand. Eventually you could create grand labyrinths with multiple floors and dozens of rooms a piece, enemies will grow in strength and their item drops will increase to match. You do not have any more control over this however, at most you may simply choose the general size and strength of each dungeon, nor will the enemies within ignore you.


-Magic Maker (The Gamer) (600CP)
        High class enchanted objects in this world are quite rare. While this is to be somewhat expected, they are also suitably expensive, due to the sheer difficulty in making them.
        You now have the skill to do so. And as a bonus, there is no drop off, no 'you must have absolutely mastered fire magic to even create a weak fire enchantment', no 'hundreds of times the power requirement to create the item'. Any magical effect you know, you can create a talisman or item to replicate. Staff of nuclear fireball, ring of haste, anything you know, you can make.


-Magic Smithing (Hellboy) (600CP)
        The Golden Army, the Crown of Bethmora, Nuada's Spear such relics as these are beyond the ken of humans. But you can not only understand their construction and the magic behind them; you can create wonders of your own. Self-repairing golems, magical artifacts that control them no matter the size of the horde, spear tips that inch ever closer to the heart and cannot be removed by mortal means and much more are possible for you to create now. Though, getting all that gold might pose a problem


-Microcosm (Greek Myth) (600CP)
        Like the shield of Achilles your creations can contain microcosms. You could place within a sword the power of a raging thunder storm, sing a song that carries the components of civilization that would allow it's most important ideas to be transmitted through it's words, even very complex ideas like how the men of Greece live and understand the world can be placed with a creation of yours. This empowers an item by allowing it to act in some way as if it were the thing imbued within it, albeit in a diminished from the form they are embodying. Striking a shield which contains a microcosm of Greece would be like trying to strike through Greece, being struck by a sword containing Greece would be like being struck by Greece. However the microcosms you place within items will be greatly reduced compared to the actual thing they are embodying. A song containing civilization would only be able to get across the most important ideas with very little nuance, a sword containing a storm would strike with the force of a single thunderbolt rather than the thousands within the true storm, being struck by a shield containing Greece would be like being hit by a mountain rather than a country. It would take incredibly intense effort to create anything containing a microcosm more powerful or complex then Greece.


-Soulfuse arts (Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension) (600CP)
        While some powerful artifacts have Immortal Spirits which can briefly animate them, these spirits are somewhat limited. Though all are powerful and many are intelligent, they cannot cultivate and therefore cannot fundamentally change themselves. The Soulfuse Arts break this limitation, allowing a loose soul to bond with a Magic Treasure as a body and cultivate with a potential of at least the Heavenly Immortal Realm. While these arts are normally practiced with existing artifact spirits, it is also possible to use them to bind other souls. At a minimum, this makes the treasures intelligent and capable of wielding themselves, though the latter is draining.


-The Master (Martial World) (600CP)
        You gained enough understanding, knowledge and experience to start the path of an inscription, array and alchemy, with this you can create new recipes and method to substitute rare, extinct ingredients and materials with common ones but has same effect and effectiveness, you can also understand any pills, array or inscription that you see instantly and replicate it with less time and materials used, this also allows to invent pills, array and inscription from scratch when facing a difficult situation that a pills, array and inscription can help like breaking through the nine stars of dao palace, post-jump this applies to potions, seals, runes, barriers as well.


-Tool Creation (Fate/Legends - Empire of Antiquity) (600CP)
        The ability to make and alter tools at an astonishing level. Designing and crafting magical tools of exceptional power is easy, from potions to magical weapons to siege engines, and even creating non-magical implements that can accomplish magical effects at a lower level is entirely possible. You could with time, design and create some of the greatest weapons wielded by heroes in this age, provided you find the tools and resources you'd need to do it. Your talents lie particularly towards weapons of destruction and war, as your inventions in that area seem to end up having far more power, lethality and effectiveness than you had expected from what you designed. Lastly, when forced to spend time amongst other living beings, you also find that your capabilities with tools can be applied in certain ways to living beings, letting you trick and manipulate other people to do what you want with quite a high degree of skill.


-Weapon Synthesis (Dark Cloud) (600CP)
        By now, you've probably come to realize that the weapons in this world are quite peculiar. We're not talking about the Slingshot that speaks to you by the way, the Fairy King had a hand in that one. How does one crystallize a weapon? We're honestly not quite sure, though the magic seems to be consistent with the Atlamillia's properties. The crystals are surely a handy way to store the weapons - but you can also use them to merge into other inanimate objects, passing down a single property of the crystallized weapon as it were.


-Protodermis (Bionicle) (800CP)
        You now know how to make the apparently omni-applicable material Protodermis! Ignoring The uses of a substance that can act as water, stone, metal, rapidly growing crystal, or organic matter as needed, the most prominent use for Protodermis is the creation of Kanoka. By pouring molten Protodermis into a frisbee-like mold and letting it cool, it attains one of eight powers -Shrinking, Enlarging, Reconstitutes at Random, Remove Poison, Regeneration, Weakness,Teleport, or Freezing. From there you can merge multiple disks to make a variety of other powers. Whatever power it has will be applied on sufficiently forceful impact. Kanoka retain their powers when forged into smaller pieces such as gears or triggers, and can also be forged into Kanohi. Kanoka power reserves last thousands of years but do eventually run out and require re-forging. Kanoka can be combined to have any Kanohi Power, as listed in the Notes section.


-Rare Talent: The Ability to Craft Ter'angreal (Luck of the Draw) (800CP)
        You have a rare talent such as, a rather impressive animagus form, being a metamorphmagus, the ability to craft ter'angreal, you're a vampire slayer, identifying magical items by looking at them, dream walking, wandless magic, creating seeds for angreal, making Cuendillar/Heartstone, reliable foretelling, force battle meditation or the like. This may be bought twice per specialty, once is enough to give you the potential to be one of the best possible with your talent, twice is enough to put you in the realm of legends. If something requires magic to work you have the minimum ability you need in order to use your talent. In other words, you could be nearly a squib and have an animagus form or wandless magic. It's highly recommended that you pick up a decent magic source to go with your talents if they require magic.
        * Generic magical items from wheel of time


-Unshackled Potential (Generic Fantasy RPG) (800CP)
        You know, for all the advantages an adventurer from a noble background holds over one with a humble origin, there isn't much disparity in terms of power level when both reach the epic levels. That's because Adventurers in general possess a ridiculous amount of potential. You, however, are a whole different animal - where even the most promising of Adventurers will one day reach the apex of their potential and be unable to advance further, you will never reach the apex of your potential because you will always be able to improve yourself in every respect, whether physical, magical, or even mundane skills, if you're into it.
        MYSTIC - The Artificer Magical artifacts, and perhaps even magi-technological artifacts if you know the right disciplines, come together under your hands and tools with the casual ease of a master. You can invent, develop, and introduce an item that can reproduce just about any magical effect you are personally capable of. While your initial prototypes might only just work, and not terribly well, you'll always be able to continually improve on your designs, with no particular ceiling in what you can manage beyond the time you're willing to invest and dedicate towards improvement. Furthermore, the rate at which you make improvements, and just design and build such artifacts in the first place, is tremendously enhanced, far beyond what other individuals that fancy themselves artificers could manage. Where the creation of magical items for the average practitioner is a long involved process requiring careful and painstaking effort, you are practically the equivalent of a one (wo)man production line. Finally, you may substitute pure magical energy for all but the rarest materials required during the creation process of your artifacts, though at an extremely unfavorable cost ratio until you dedicate significant time and effort towards refining this ability.


-Crafting Classes | Realm of Heroes | Level 100 (Overlord - The Series) (1100CP)
        Crafting Classes (200CP)
        You now possess classes and abilities aspected towards and in the service of creating a specific type of craft or trade good, and will be able to easily come up with new recipes or innovations for the crafts you select. Examples include cooking, smithing, scroll making, jewelry crafting, and so forth. For 50 cp you may choose one specific type of craft, however for 200cp you may instead have crafting abilities that are equally applicable to every possible crafting pursuit. Examples include food and drinks that give low level buffs when eaten, low end (but still serviceable) magical weapons, armors, and misc magic items, and so forth. The sort of equipment that would be considered useful and practical enough (in terms of use and cost) for even a more experienced adventurer to eye them appreciatively and think them a worthy addition to their arsenal.
        In the Realm of Heroes however you could make items that would be considered national treasures by the locals, things like swords so sharp that they could hit 'above their level' such as damaging someone that would normally ignore them (for example, bypassing the high-tier physical nullification of a level 100), rings of potent regeneration and stamina recovery, masterwork armor that even a hero would be honored to wear, food and drink that could potentially heal a man of injury instantly or empower him to staggering heights (temporarily at least), and so forth.
        At Level One Hundred however your crafting skills have hit their zenith. At this point you could make items on par with Divine Tier equipment, things even beings of godlike strength would find no complaint in, or foods and drinks so nourishing that someone might not need to eat or drink for a month or more afterwards, and conveying extremely potent temporary buffs alongside that. However, of course, no matter what your level of skill one simple fact remains; your skills are largely worthless without materials to use them with. While you might be able to take even subpar ingredients and fashion something workable only with truly excellent materials will you be able to craft something genuinely great, especially at the highest levels of crafting.
        Realm of Heroes (300CP)
        You have stepped into a realm that only the greatest that have ever lived can truthfully claim to be a part of.
        If you are a Warrior you could potentially cut down an army of a thousand regular men all by yourself, and would be capable of feats of skill and martial prowess that would leave regular folk in stunned awe of your capabilities, and have them whispering that maybe you aren't a mortal at all.
        If you are a Magic Caster you are capable of spells up to the sixth tier, believed to be the highest tier of magic that a mortal could possibly ever achieve. Spells of the sixth tier can perform things that would be miraculous to the common folk, such as resurrecting the dead, teleporting over unbelievable distances without error, summoning forth powerful creatures as servitors, or potentially casting spells that would let you defeat upwards of a hundred men with no more than a few words and gestures.
        If you are a Generalist your luck, wit, cunning, and skill are so profound that you have an answer for virtually every situation, and while your combat prowess won't be as great as a warrior of the same level, and your magic won't be as good as a magic caster of the same level, you'll far outstrip anyone that isn't in the realm of heroes in those abilities.
        Level 100 (600CP)
        You've hit the pinnacle. There is no higher level, not within YGGDRASIL at least. As a Player you have hit level 100, not exactly a surprise since most Players had done that, and represent the absolute peak of personal power and ability. If you're a Local then you're quite frankly a freak of nature and are probably seen as a god by any other locals that actually know what you're really capable of. Literally, by the way, the Slane Theocracy actually worships as gods a group of six level one hundred Players that appeared to them in the past, though virtually no one still alive outside the highest echelons of the Theocracy itself actually knows that. All level one hundred individuals possess high-tier nullification defensive abilities. This means that individuals won't be able to even hurt you that aren't, at the very least, within the fabled 'Realm of Heroes' and even then they'd have to be a hero among heroes to manage it, and they'd still have to get past your normal defenses even if they manage that much. The only hope they'd normally have is if they possessed access to some magical artifact of sufficient power to get past your defenses. That said the high-tier nullification is an all or nothing ability, either it works or it doesn't.
        Your physical and magical statistics are absolutely mind boggling as far as the locals are concerned. Even magic casters, if they're level one hundred, will possess physical strength and defenses on par with a warrior that is 'only' in the 'Realm of Heroes', and warriors can expect to be far far beyond even that. Magic casters actual magic power is enough that it could literally bring even the greatest human archmage to his knees in awe and shame at his own weakness, were he to actually witness your true strength. Even warriors that only dabbled in magic would still be on par with magic casters in the 'Realm of Heroes' at the very least. The abilities of a Generalist, both physical and magical, will outstrip everyone other than their level 100 peers by a tremendous degree.
        As a warrior you are capable of annihilating armies of tens of thousands of regular men on your own, and likely wouldn't even notice them. It would take legendary heroes or beasts to actually make you break your stride. You'll possess skills that will let you nullify certain damage types outright, perform swings of your weapon that can hit dozens of individuals at once with air pressure alone, and provide you with a myriad of defenses against magic casters that would seek to stymie you and prevent you from closing the distance. You are literally a one-man army killing machine. As a Warrior you additionally possess 'super moves' that can do things like grant temporary invulnerability to virtually anything, allow you to strike everything in your line of sight with a single powerful blow at the same time, or hit one opponent dozens of times with a single strike.
        As a magic caster you are capable of casting spells of every tier up to the 10th Tier. This is a tier of magic that only a bare handful of people in the entire world even know exists, with most believing that 7th tier is as high as it goes. 10th Tier magic is the stuff of legends, capable of healing armies or slaying them, resurrecting the dead en mass, permanent teleportation circles, 'buffing' or 'debuffing' entire armies, summoning forth creatures of legend as servitors, and so forth. As a Magic Caster you'll also be capable of 'Over-rank Magic', also known as Super-tier magic, that exceeds even that. Singular spells that could slay 70,000 men in one go and then also summon massively powerful eldritch nightmares under your command at the same time, destroying entire cities with rain that infects those it falls upon with an undead plague, conjuring forth miles upon miles of enchanted forest that responds to your will and will empower you while you are within, or spells of similar such scale and effect. Unlike normal spells 'over-rank' spells don't actually cost mana and are more akin to skills, they always have a long casting time, usually a minute or so, and you must stand still and can not do anything else while casting them. Additionally you can only use them a few times per day.
        If you are a Generalist there really isn't a question of 'can you do something' so much as 'how do you do it today, and will you do it differently tomorrow'. You're not quite on the same tier of skill as the warrior at combat, or the magic caster at magic, but you're just below both of them. Magic of the 9th tier is yours to command, and while you're not the combat beast a warrior could be you find that your command of both the physical and magical aspects give you a range of utility and versatility no one else could boast. As a Generalist you don't benefit from super moves or over-rank magic but in compensation your statistics are significantly better overall in the areas where the other origins would be weak. You do have one area however where you particularly shine. You are blisteringly fast. You could run circles around the warrior even if you couldn't beat him at swordplay, and you can certainly close the distance (or run away) from a magic caster in the blink of an eye. You've also picked up a penchant for sneak attacks, and opponents that don't see you coming rarely get the opportunity to learn from that mistake.


-A Messy Process | Preservation of Ruin | Hemalurgic Genius (Mistborn) (1200CP)
        A Messy Process (200CP)
        You have a basic knowledge of Hemalurgy. You know which metals steal which attributes, if you didn't already. More importantly, you have a basic knowledge of the bind points on a human body, and you have a superhumanly steady hand when preparing to drive sharp metal objects into someone's body, even your own. In addition to some minor combat benefits, you can safely use place a hemalurgic spike into somebody's body in the exact right location to avoid injuring them and allowing them to draw on its power. However, the ability to twist humans into nonhuman forms or to implant hemalurgic spikes into nonhumans is beyond you. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane.
        Preservation of Ruin (400CP)
        You can now charge a Hemalurgic spike without killing the victim. So long as the metal touches their still coursing blood, energy will be drained from the victim to charge the spike, leaving them alive. A spike made in this fashion will be slightly less powerful, but will last longer outside a human body. A victim drained by this ability will become noticeably paler, and their personality will shift to become slightly more dour and less energetic. If the drained attribute is a supernatural ability, it is removed entirely if it is a natural ability such as strength, it is radically weakened. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane.
        Hemalurgic Genius (600CP)
        You are a genius in the art of Hemalurgy. You have the knowledge to twist a humans form into a variety of shapes with Hemalurgy, creating entirely new creatures formed from the hemalurgic charge in the spike and the recipient's own soul. This process usually requires multiple spikes, and twisting a human too far from their natural form can destroy their mind. The more a person is twisted in this fashion, the more powerful the charge in their spikes becomes, enhancing whatever abilities they gain from it. You also gain the ability to find the bind points in any nonhuman creature. Creatures that are largely humanoid only take a few minutes of visual inspection animals can take hours of intensive study. Sufficiently bizarre creatures may require days or weeks, and you may need to perform vivisection or other intrusive and indepth analysis in order fully map the creature's bind points. As a side benefit, hemalurgic spikes you make are more efficient, storing greater chargers and degrading slower than normal. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane. Furthermore, attempting to use this ability without A Messy Process results in having very little control over the exact mutations your subject manifests. You know which bind points trigger mutation, but without the knowledge of which bind point does what you're largely striking blind. Experimentation can teach you, of course.


-Soulcraft | Sage (Demons' Souls) (1200CP)
        Soulcraft (600CP)
        With the souls of strong opponents, you may forge great weapons and armor out of them. Of course you can craft with lesser souls but the product won't be that great. The weaker souls can only be used to upgrade things instead. You instinctively understand how to use anything you made.
        Sage (600CP)
        In magic you have few equals, many of them brilliant prodigies much like yourself. Your intelligence improves the damages of your spells. With study you can turn great souls into powerful spells to be used. Weaker souls can be used to improve your magic


-Maker's Prodigy | Maker (Darksiders) (1800CP)
        Maker's Prodigy (600CP)
        The makers decide to teach you the ways of creation and you may choose to become their pupil, they will teach you how to create magical artifacts, imbue places and objects with power and even how to create magical constructs with sentience. Regardless if you spend the time learning from them or not, you will find you learn future skills related to creation, enchantment and forging will come to you as if they were second nature, waiting to be remembered.
        Maker (1200CP)
        You gain an alternate form of a maker, broad, Immensely strong and around 12 feet tall. You also gain supernatural powers of creation, able to make impossible things from practically nothing. Though it may take many years of practice, you will be able to master the art of crafting life from clay, Forge magic spells from ideas of the mind, and matter from nothing. Creator's spark: If you ascend and receive a Planeswalkers spark, you will find your knowledge of crafting extends unto the impossible and the laws of reality. You may eventually create new worlds from the void and forge new forces such as a unique form of magic or entropy as you create the new plane.

-Crystal Mechanics (Final Fantasy Type 0) (100CP)
        The Byakko Crystal's blessing revolves around the synthesis and comprehension of technology using magic. After all, sufficiently advanced technology is no different from magic. You can understand the workings of advanced technology after tinkering around with it a bit. You can also replicate technology you see by using magic, but until you've attempted it countless times, the end product always seems to feel a bit...lesser in comparison to the original.


-Inspiration (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (100CP)
        Ideas crash like thunder through a genius' life every moment of their lives, barely contained, often barely understood. This is Inspiration, the illumination within, the raw stuff of genius. The greater a genius' Inspiration, the more power of creation and destruction she possesses. But there is a cost. As a genius Inspiration increases, she becomes less able to understand mundane concerns. She struggles to hold onto her Obligation, as people seem more like systems to be explored than individuals with their own lives and concerns. As she becomes almost godlike in her perspective, she must focus to concentrate on the mortal world and its concerns. As your Inspiration grows the buring power of Mania grows with it. All Genii start with a free purchase of Inspiration, Lemurians get three purchases free. It cost 100 CP to upgrade Inspiration. Your Inspiration can not exceed 10, free purchases included. In addition to all of this you will suffer from the Jabir for the entirety of the Jump. As a genius grows more powerful, his Inspiration shines out of him to illuminate the world. This can be a curse for those mad scientists who want to look more "scientist" than "mad." The genius' Mania begins to tamper with perception and procedure, skewing any attempt to engage in normal science or to perform normal experiments. Though the genius himself suffers no penalties, the odd effects from his perception "cancel out" when brought into conjunction with the odd effects from his behavior he struggles to communicate his ideas to others. Modern geniuses call this "technobabble" in an attempt to soften the horror of the phenomenon, but it's formally known as Jabir, a sudden, paralyzing loss of clarity and coherence when a genius interacts with a regular mortal.
        * Can be bought 10 times, 100CP each time.


-Magitek (Diabolical) (100CP)
        Rather than being based on technology, you may change your theme to being based upon magic, sorcery, or other metaphysical terms such as divine blessing. Rather than lasers your goons might use magic staves, instead of hovertanks you might have supernatural creatures with durability and power to match. At least you don't have to worry about power sources or that pesky physics thing getting in the way. This can also apply a magic-based sci-fi theme, hence the name. You have sufficient expertise in your newly chosen theme that you can create and invent within the confines of it, at the level of a true master. Even if you don't have previous experience in it, this will grant you all you need.


-Tinkerer (Azeroth) (100CP)
        You are gifted at mixing technology and magic. You can make a helmet that shrinks the world! Or maybe it just makes you really really big. It's the magic of science! You are also capable of creating the car-sized piloted mechs (Like Mekkatorques), robots, and auto turrets.


-Apparatus (Mage the Ascension - Panopticon) (200CP)
        You have a knack for creating and using tools to solve problems. Implants, weapon systems, manufacturing facilities, all sorts of technology; you know how to take the basic principles of the universe and put them to work. Along with an intuitive grasp of how to use any technologies you encounter (though not necessarily how they work), if you understand an ability, you can create an apparatus to replicate that ability using its own physics. If it's not something you yourself can do, you might need some assistance or 'assistance' from someone or something which can, but as long as you have that and understand the base principles, you're good to go.


-Doll Maker of Bucuresti (Touhou) (200CP)
        Being an undisputable genius in terms of mathematics and science in a realm ruled by magic tends to undermine just how impressive it is. Your ability with technology and engineering is so great that you are able to adapt to handling, repairing, modifying and even reverse-engineering completely foreign devices you have little to no background on. Your connection with both practical technologies along with magic allows for you to eventually unlock the secrets to creating magitech if given enough time to experiment.


-Hardcore Materialist (Mage the Ascension - Panopticon) (200CP)
        Everything is stuff, or built out of stuff. You can create things that disregard all that nitty-gritty through abstraction layers, but ultimately all those things humanity sees and values ideas, morality, etc. are arrangement of substance. Substance can be analyzed and reconfigured. You may now treat various ephemeral or esoteric things as being essentially physical and material; ghosts, mental abstracts, divine essence, etc. Maybe not tangible with normal means, but material. With some practice, you can manipulate these substances and even alloy them with other materials, use them as computing substrates, or a host of other things.


-Mi-Go (Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement) (200CP)
        You are a master of arcane sciences it would never occur to any human to pursue. If that seems frightfully vague, well, look at it as an opportunity to- shall we say?- expand your mind.


-Moderately Peeved SCIENCE!!! (Mage the Ascension - Panopticon) (200CP)
        In the halls of the Etherites, scientific theories based off discarded hypotheses, alternate interpretations, and way too much enthusiasm are constantly debated, and tested, and 'proven' free of the constraints of the scientific establishment. And often, these theories seem to each work even when mutually contradictory, often in the same room. You've worked out how to handle such chaotic innovation in a way that is moderately stable. By attaching subsystems working off wildly disparate understandings of the universe, you can nonetheless make them function well together, with a bit of phlebotinum and GENIUS mixed in. This will never be as stable as putting in the same effort to make something based off an actually coherent theoretical basis, but it's close!


-Setup Wizard (Harry Potter) (200CP)
        You have a natural knack of melding technology and magic. You can easily jury-rig technology to work at Hogwarts. Your inventions could do considerable good for the magical world if they weren't all such luddites.


-The Mystic and the Machine (Marvel Cosmic) (200CP)
        The argument between mystics and technology is a faulty one. There is no need to choose one as they enhance and complement one another. Like a certain Mad Titan you have unlocked mastery of combining these two pathways to power. You can always find ways to combine any mystical knowledge you have with any scientific or technical knowledge. This differs from Fine line in that it is all about creating magitech. It also allows you to make a technological version of any magic you know, or a magical version of any technology you can build. All power sources between the two become cross compatible as well. Only fools choose one when they can have both.


-Technosorcery (Gargoyles) (300CP)
        Combining magic and technology is a no brainer for you. You can handily blend the two to create amazing effects like broadcasting spells over telephone lines or melding creatures together through sorcerous surgery. Very little in the field of technomagic is beyond your reach with this skill.


-Adaptation (GURPS Technomancer) (400CP)
        It's surprising how quickly magic takes to being adapted to technology and vice versa. With only a bit of work, you're capable of creating spells and enchantments that are capable of replicating technology, or technological devices capable of replicating spells and enchantments. With a bit of work, you can even marry the two, taking the best of both worlds to create wonders that take advantage of both the usability of technology and the rule-bending power of magic.


-Arcane Interface (Storm Hawks) (400CP)
        While many places and inanimate items are magical, magic itself normally requires a living thing to evoke it. Not so with this perk. You gain insight into creating a technological interface for magical items so that people not versed in magic can pick up and use them. Send a golem instructions through a PDA, or activate a portal with a TV remote. For those capable of magic, this Perk also gives insight into designing spells that manipulate technology, such as conjuring complex machines or altering computer data.


-Clarketech (Generic Space Opera) (400CP)
        Not only are you able to reverse engineer, extrapolate from, and eventually replicate with a device of your own make any technology you encounter, you also are able to do so with any other phenomenon, be it a physical occurrence, magical or even divine in nature, or even just theorised by you to be possible, though in the latter case you naturally will encounter failure if your theories prove false, in addition to research and prototyping taking a prohibitively long time to do.


-Clockwork Kingdom (Dark Souls 2) (400CP)
        Yeah working with souls and other special materials is great and all but you don't have that. You've got men, iron and a little bit of the old razzle dazzle. You know what? That's enough to fucking build up an entire kingdom and you can show that off. Near mythological abilities as an engineer. With a basic knowledge of sorcery and excessive skill with clockwork machinations you could create automatons that can follow simple commands, traps that reset and resupply themselves and self-maintaining machines. Although the things you make are marvelous in function, the most spectacular aspect of this perk is their sheer endurance. Despite the moving parts and small components, even when exposed to the elements and left unmaintained, unless deliberately broken they seemingly just keep working forever.


-From Trinitite to Powerstones (GURPS Technomancer) (400CP)
        The world of Technomancer does not stand still, and science marches forever onward, even when mana gets involved. And perhaps one of the best ways to march onward is to steal liberally from natural phenomena. You can, by examining a natural magical effect for a few days, figure out how to replicate that phenomena with a spell.


-Getting With The Times (Highschool DxD) (400CP)
        The whole 'brimstone and fire' thing is great and all, but the sad fact is that humans have changed much over the centuries, and so it falls onto the supernatural world to change with them. You're something of a pioneer, able to combine both technology and magic together seamlessly to create unique inventions of superscience...things like a hatred-powered robot, or blueprints for something based off of the Evil Piece system. With a little time and ingenuity, who knows what you'll put together?


-Magic For Dummies specialization: MagiTech (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (400CP)
        I see that you are interested in the next one of these. In particular, this series is quite stressful, I can either give you one that covers the basics of most magic systems or you can choose something more specialized. The more focused, the better results you will get. Don't worry about affinities either, there are some notes inside of how to work around that.


-Magic Marches On (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (400CP)
        Ground's Nir might lag behind Earth in terms of technology, but not for too long with you at the helm of scientific advance. Perhaps science isn't the best word. You're not any better at making actual computers out of sticks and raw metal but you are brilliant at making magical or fantastical versions of existing technology you know about. Vehicles powered by magic, calculating systems running on willpower, rocket launchers made with magical materials. Long as you know how to make the original technology, you'll be able to create a magical variation of that technology that is every bit as effective.


-Magical Science (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (400CP)
        They said it was impossible, but you showed them the error of their ways. Magic and science work on completely different sets of physics, yet, you have managed to merge them into one set, for a myriad of purposes. Be to make artifacts with instant spells imbued into them, physical doors that lead to other worlds or dimensions, or changing the energy output/input from magical items. The possibilities are endless.... As long as you have the necessary materials.


-Mind in the Machine (Generic Creepypasta) (400CP)
        Folklore is filled with stories of spirits, but it's only in recent years where they seem to haunt more technological homes. You know a few methods of binding spirits to technological devices to create things like haunted video games or video tapes. These spirits, in addition to the abilities you might expect from their kind, will also have a large amount of control over the contents of their home, altering footage or programming to sow terror.


-Mystical Mechanica (Dragon Ball) (400CP)
        Did you ever wonder how on Earth Bulma Briefs was able to invent a working radar for a mystical set of artifacts left mostly to myth and rumor? Not anymore you don't. You are able to create devices that are able to detect mystical energies and properties. More than that, you know how to reconcile magical devices and technology, able to combine the two should you have the skills and abilities for either.


-Pankosmoi, the Needle Grail (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        A pipedream housed inside a house of smoke and mirrors. This is the hidden Axiom. With this the manifestation of a person's Mania could be pushed over the edge and into a real physical law, unique to this power, thus all things that were built by you within this Axiom are now real actualized repeatable phenomena unless you choose not to add in the element of Pankosmoi to the Wonder itself. Now the creation of Wonders is a true reality, a 'hard science' if you will. This also stacks with any other engineering or technological knowledge you have, letting you incorporate Wondrous features, such as the non-repeatable phenomena without Havoc or something to that effect, and update other technologies seamlessly into a greater whole of science. This uniquely affects the capstones of each background (See Notes) as well as provides the following benefited options to all Genius' Wonders: all of the Genius' Wonders are immune to the effects of Havoc, the Genius gains the ability to take an impossible fact of the world and create a Bardo with it, and finally the ability to destroy non-sentient matter to harvest massive amounts of Mania from Reality itself.


-Project: Black Book (Freddy vs Jason vs Ash) (400CP)
        With the existence of the supernatural, is it any surprise that science has advanced further as well? In secret labs beneath the capital, scientists work to unravel the secrets of the paranormal- creating machines to translate the Necronomicon, finding ways to open portals to the Deadite's dimension to retrieve Freddy Krueger, even attempting to find a way to replicate Jason Voorhees's unique condition. You have an increased knowledge of science that could make these things possible for you to do. Hopefully, you'll be a little smarter about it than Uncle Sam was.


-Stress Testing (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        The working of wonders is an act of Inspiration. It is not so fundamentally buried in the ways of science as to ignore other outlets and some folk in the Hermetic Order of 28 Spheres has turned you to their experiments in this area. With this perk you will be able to find and utilize the Clarke Line, this is in reference to Clarke's Law that states that sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from sufficiently advanced technology, to create technology so close to magic as to count as it. The 'science' behind this must still always be consistent internally but it can now benefit from things that would usually only be the prudence of magic, including perks. This means that magic and perks that benefit magic can affect Wonders as if Wonders were magic.


-Technomagical Gal (Smash Up Big In Japan) (400CP)
        Your magic combines very easily with technology, boosting and enhancing it. You can charm devices to run off mana, work with greater strength, self-repair and generally function better. It's so cool how you can use magic and tech both to do things neither could alone!


-Technomancy (World of Darkness - Mage: The Awakening) (400CP)
        Using technology with magic is not a new practice, especially since technology has existed since man first made fire, or tied a stone to a stick and called it a spear. While there are many other mages who purport to merge technology and magic, you do so with such seamless efficiency that it is nearly impossible to tell where technology ends and magic begins. You could tie the triggering of a spell to a computer program, having it take effect when someone tries to open it. Or perhaps you could use your magic to improve the quality of machines, increasing their speed, effectiveness and overall power. Perhaps you could even write out a grimoire, a repository of magical knowledge into a simple graphing calculator. Whatever you do, it will likely be creative and never seen before as the disparate disciplines are masterfully merged under your guidance.


-The Control Variable (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        The Non-Repeatable Phenomenon, an impossibility that can only happen due to the presence of Mania, has but one rule that must always be followed; the internal continuity of the Phenomenon must always be consistent. Using an understanding of raw physics and the laws of the world as defined by the absence of Mania as the base of all of you experiments was an Inspired choice. You now have the ability to create a Control, a variable that can only change when you personally change, which allows you to change your Aesthetic to 'Real World Technology' but the more powerful effects are that you can use this practice to bind Mania to the idea of a wonder and allow it to be mass produced, though this doesn't allow you to stop Havoc it does make it so you could create functionally identical Wonders without a limit as mass production is a cornerstone of the modern technological world, and that you can, with an explanation of the process to work and maintain the Wonder, allow people to 'count as' Beholden, humans who through no Inspiration of their own slip into the worldview of a Genius and can use Wonders, for the purposes of not causing Havoc. You can switch between your chosen Aesthetic and the one provided by The Control Variable at will.
        * Designed to let you mass produce a form of magitech


-A Correlation of Constants Between Physical Reality and Wondrous Artifice Creation (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (600CP)
        The work of a lifetime transcribed into your mind. The simplistic wish to have something real and valid in one's own hands materialized into a theory, not a Law, which by all rights should not exist as it does. All forms of Mania comes from the unknowable power of Inspiration but if looked at from another angle one can not help but to find themselves gazing backwards, after all even myths and legends usually have a grain of truth to them. Using a method of your own devising you have figured out how to break something down until you find the core idea that made it real in the first place, granting you an astounding ability to understand the working of something through proper physics. You can take any Non-Repeatable Phenomenon and translate it into a Repeatable Phenomena at the cost of exorbitant power and size upgrades. You have also reversed one of the eldest uses of Mania, the ability to power even mundane things as if with electricity, so that you can power your inventions on electricity instead of Mania.


-A Master of the Axioms (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (600CP)
        Axioms are the 'channels' of mania that make the most orderly and understandable Wonders happen. The Axioms are not reliable, by any means, let alone consistent. A genius can imagine them as knots of cohesion floating in a vast illuminated sea of Idea, little islands where things almost make sense, though the shoreline shifts fractally with every passing second. Mastering each of the Axioms in turn allows a Genius to gain control of aspects of his own Wondrous works. A master of Axioms can do things beyond the scope of his fellows and has a true grasp of the deeper weirdness that comes with Mania. You have become a master of these powerful foundations. Most look at you in awe but you still feel there is further to go yet. In addition to this mastery of the Axioms allows you to utilize any other engineering or technological knowledge that you have, allowing you to make those types of devices as Wonders as well, enhancing their traits by doing so. Aside from the ability to create wonders from technology your Inspiration also allows you to see how the various technologies could be used together. Though this insight is small and it will take work to realize.


-At The Precipice of Magic and Science (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time) (600CP)
        At the precipice of science and magic there are untold wonders, imaginations made real through their power. Power that may soon be yours. You are a master of both science and magical knowledge, to the extent that the combination of the two is but a small affair, and though you are not yet an equal to the long dead hero Zakkart, with time you will be his match, and perhaps even exceed him. With time, effort, and study, it would not be unusual to see you creating technomagical wonders on par with the atomic bomb, or even greater things still such as the Root of Life, a material capable of healing any injury and even creating entirely new bodies by connecting not to the body, but the soul. This and far more fantastical creations will one day be at your fingertips.


-Atop The World (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (600CP)
        Walk this path carefully. This is the art that both saved, and destroyed Hyrule. You have unlocked knowledge of the greatest force multiplier the Sheikah were ever able to field - Large, walking, warmachines. You have a basic knowledge of the Sheikah's art of automation and robotics, with this alone giving you the knowledge to craft the small Guardians utilized by Shrines in combat tests, with the right materials. However, with enough resources and development time...you could create constructs that could even rival the 4 great Divine Beasts. This is the pure expression of Power...just remember that Power must be tempered with Wisdom, and wielded with Courage. Power without restraint is the domain of Calamity Ganon, after all.


-Cyber Sorcerer (Digimon World Re: Digitize) (600CP)
        No one would ever confuse you for a faceless technician; in fact probably quite a few people would be grateful for the chance to meet you. A genius within the fields of programming and electronics capable of not only preventing civilization from being flung back to the dark ages after cataclysmic disaster, but help lead it to the world of tomorrow one innovation at a time. A true peer to the great minds of GIGO, or perhaps even one of the brilliant minds that have assured it's domination of the tech industry world wide. However, such genius goes beyond the bounds of what might be considered 'conventional' science and engineering. While the creation of something akin to the Digitization Phenomenon Program would require years worth of concerted efforts between dozens of genius on your level; the creation of applications such as digivices capable of affecting the world, machines able to detect and interact with other realms, and the creation of self-evolving AIs are well within your grasp. Truly, yours is a mind that could usher in a new golden age for mankind; or its destruction


-Gear Formation (Gonna Be a Twin-Tail) (600CP)
        The secrets of Affinity technology have been unveiled to your eyes and to your mind. You are able to create and even modify the Gears that are powered by Affinities and to use Affinities to power or alter other technology as well. Gears are created by a special process that requires the investment of one or more extremely strong Affinities on a permanent basis, so try not to use one of your own Affinities. You can also use Affinities to grant unique effects or powers to other things that you craft, investing them into the project to grant it an 'enchantment' based on what Affinity was put in, similar to the unique powers that Ultimaguil members often wield. With a bit of work, you can even use any important part of a monster as a substitute for this, sacrificing organs like a heart or brain of some monster to grant a unique ability to something that you are creating.


-Mad (Make a Wish) (600CP)
        You are mad, who else would try to mix magic with science, you though have seen the idiocy in the distinction of magic and science, to you they are all but one, knowledge of magic helps science and knowledge of science help magic, though only in related fields, the more specific you are in a field, the narrower the focus of the boost to related fields, for example knowledge of thermodynamics will help in spells and magic related to temperature, ice and fire and vice versa in case of science, but with knowledge of combustion will only help in fire magic and the like. Another benefit of your madness is that any project, whether it be a mega-structure, a vehicle, a weapon or a utility device, when created through a mixture of magic and science will cover the disadvantages and weaknesses and improve the benefits and advantages of similar devices, compared to those created with only science or magic.


-Magitech Master (World Seed) (600CP)
        If you looked at Neolife's technology for only a bit, you'd be surprised to see that it is not technology at all. Well, not pure technology at least. Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you've taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset.
        First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it's something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it.
        The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you'd be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection.
        But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there's no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create.


-Magitech wizard (Dog Days) (600CP)
        You are able to easily combine magic and technology, letting you make things like radio antennae and signal boosters that rely on magic. Maybe you could replace ammunition with bolts of magic. With this you can replicate the effects of technology with magic, and it will likely be less complex too. This isn't a one way process however, you may also replicate the effects of magic with technology. This will be much more complex than the alternative however.


-Magitek Mastery (Final Fantasy VI) (600CP)
        In essence, magitek is simply the use of magical energies as a power and fuel source for technology. Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own.
        By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source.
        From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers.
        Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully.
        There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in.


-Man Made World (Fate/Grand Order) (600CP)
        When Nikola Tesla took the secret of lightning to humanity, he spat in the face of Gods and Magicians alike. He had taken the divine and made it mundane for the sake of humanity and that act gave him genuine, immense power. While some may point to the ridiculousness of his science becoming supernatural, one can't ignore the power that technology gained, especially against the supernatural.
        You are a true creator in the same vein as Tesla himself now. The technology you create is supernaturally empowered, becoming more and more so the wider spread your technology is in the world you are in and the more your technology advances that world. If you created and spread around the world the secret of electricity, which revolutionised the entire world, you would then be able to create electrical devices that allowed you to do battle with even some of the mightiest Servants in history. Your technology is also imbued with even greater power than normal when used against Divine opponents, as the Gods seem to have an innate aversion to the progress you bring..


-Mind of the Sun (Exalted - The Solars) (600CP)
        Many speak of the First Age and its lost wonders, forgotten and quietly waiting for the return of their masters. However, far too many fixate on what was and what could have been, instead of looking towards the future, and you are not one who has time to waste rummaging around old ruins for secrets. Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis. You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in worlds without materials such as orichalum.


-Science and Sorcery (Marvel Magic) (600CP)
        Ordinarily magic and science are anathema to one another. Magic is not so simple or subservient that it can be mapped out with laws and hypotheses and will often take offense to attempts to do so, spitefully refusing to cooperate just as you think you're beginning to understand. For you, however, this is an entirely different story. Not only do you find it easy to mimic the effects of technology with magic or vice-versa, but you are talented at melding the two together into something more than the sum of its parts.


-Song Science (Ar Tonelico) (600CP)
        Before there was Song Magic, in the golden age of the First Era it was discovered that three materials, Parameno, Grathnode and Ardel, allowed for the conversion of sound into magic. From this, came the Tower and all its glories - as well as the eventual destruction of the world. Long forgotten, you have a complete theoretical knowledge of the true underpinnings of Song Magic, Reyvateil biology and the Tower as was understood at the height of the First Era. With sufficient resources, you are capable of creating or altering reyvateil, and repair and alteration to Tower hardware, something it has gone millennia without. With resources comparable to a superpower, you could potentially could raise your own Tower or complete Metafalss.
        Song Science allows for the precisely targeted creation of energy fields and semi-permanent matter, such as fireballs, giant swords, force-fields or functional computer systems allowing a Tower to sing itself into existence from a seed. It can apply this to control the weather, manipulate gravity, create life, transmute existing material into new objects, broadcast power with no loss rate within its range, mirror a Halfblood's mind on the SH Server in real-time, convert matter into digital data and vice versa. It cannot create permanent matter, which is mediated by the Wills of the Planet allowing it to become a part of their body.


-Technomancy (World Seed) (600CP)
        Often hailed as the most innovative magic, users of Technomancy are capable of creating, controlling, scanning, and even assimilating technology with magic. And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully be said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease.
        If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself.
        But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don't even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced.
        Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I'm sure that with your potential, you'll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package.


-Technomage | Merlin Returned (Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction) (1200CP)
        Technomage (600CP)
        There is so much more to magic than what these stuffy inbred old purebloods believe, and you can show them! You are an absolute master of the art of Techno-Magic. Making machines that run on magic, or just magical equivalents of Muggle technology, or something as simple as just making muggle devices work in magical environments is all child's play for you. You can translate flawlessly between technology and magic, meaning that you can make technological equivalents to all magic you know and magical equivalents to all technology you can make without losing so much as an iota of effectiveness.
        Merlin Returned Boosted - While being good at merging magic and technology is pretty good, being able to merge wildly futuristic technology with highly advanced magic is better. Not only are you highly skilled at magic, but you're now just as good at the technology side of it, being a certifiable genius among geniuses. Your merged devices now run far superior to either the magic or the tech would run alone, providing dramatically higher effectiveness and utility. In addition, your skills with the more 'technical' branches of magic, such as Arithmancy and such cross all imagined levels. Finally, you can achieve even things normally believed impossible through combining spells and technology. You can dispense with the more symbolic and ritualistic components of any and all magic you do, making it entirely as reproducible as technology.
        Merlin Returned (600CP) (Capstone Booster)
        There were ancient tales of your coming, Jumper. Actually, wait, no. There weren't. But there should have been. You were born to greatness, and this reflects in everything you do. Magic is second nature to you. While you don't get any skill or knowledge innate with this perk, nor any gifts or talents that pass down bloodlines or through rituals, you now have limitless talent in every single branch of magic apart from these limitations. Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years' worth of material in days and weeks without even stressing yourself. This growth continues indefinitely, never slowing no matter what. Your grasp of magic and its theoretical framework is such that you can manipulate the very nature of it, and do so with an almost contemptuous ease. You can take apart spells, rituals or even entire magic systems, and put them back together in whatever different arrangement you like, even in entirely new magic systems of your own. Even altering spells in real time is second nature to you, changing their effects, size, scope, everything. As is coming up with entirely new pieces of magic, with due research and innovation.
        Finally, to fuel all this, your 'Magical Core', per se, is proportionately vast. You have a humongous amount of magic at your fingertips, stretching far and beyond any known metrics well into the realm of legends like Merlin and the Founders. This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective perks.


-Golem Crafting | Machine Crafting | Stupidly Powerful | 17 (Dragon-Half) (1400CP)
        Golem Crafting (400CP)
        You have studied not only magic and crafting, but how to blend the two, allowing you to create golems using a variety of materials. These golems are powered and animated by the magic you instill in them, requiring a well-crafted form suitable for enchanting. The larger and more powerful the construct, the longer it takes to create. Your constructs are capable of what limited independent thought and action might be necessary to carry out relatively simple orders. This style of creating magical constructs is light on crafting and heavy on magic.
        Golem Crafting SP: Your connection to your magical creations is especially strong, which has allowed you to figure out how to summon any of them to your side with a few words and a gesture, no matter where they might be.
        Machine Crafting (400CP)
        Golem crafters make enchanted mobile sculptures. You consider this crude and inefficient. You know that by carefully designing and assembling all the moving parts, you can make things that require far less magic to power them. Not only are your creations more energy efficient, they are also faster, more versatile, able to follow more complex commands... And less durable. The unfortunate downside of building complex machines is that tiny moving parts are easier to break than carved blocks of stone. This style of creating magical constructs is heavy on crafting and light on magic.
        Machine Crafting SP: You have figured out space compression enchantments that allow your creations to have more stored within them than they should be able to hold. This allows you to pack them full of tools, weapons, extra cargo space, or mess with their designs in imaginative ways.
        Stupidly Powerful (600CP)
        You are an exceptional example of your origin, both mightier and more impressive than the ordinary. You gain enhanced versions of every perk you buy that is free or discounted for your origin. These enhancements are marked SP in each perk description. Unfortunately this also means that you draw a lot of attention to yourself, and are an interesting topic of conversation. You gain the Light Speed Gossip drawback for +0cp.
        17 (0CP)
 Your maturity grants you insight and focus, allowing you to craft constructs that are far more powerful than before in a fraction of the time that it used to take you to build your old weaker ones.




 --- Domain: Quality: Appearance (31) (35 Perks) --- 




-Pure Art (Destiny - Old) (0CP)
        The visual arts may not be your thing, but that doesn't mean you can't be good at it. With this, you will be able to adorn any object you possess with paint or some other kind of marker and make it look good. You can paint armor, vehicles and weapons. Depending on what you portray, it could evoke different emotions. From fear to inspiration. You must have some skill at drawing or painting, and something to draw or paint with.


-Transmogrification (World of Warcraft) (0CP)
        Have a set of armor that you like? Yet you like another set of armor's stats? Well don't fret! Transmog machine is here! What is it? It looks like a giant washing machine, you can feed any two sets of armor (Head, Chest, Legs, Boots, & Gloves) and choose which one is spit out. The new armor will be the best of both worlds. It'll have the superior stats of the one item, and looks of the other. However the downside is that the other item is destroyed. However both items are in a database so you can always transmog the look. Don't bother taking it apart and trying to figure out how it works, because there's no answer. It just works.


-My Fashion Sense is Tingling (The World Ends With You) (50CP)
        You have an impeccable sense of fashion. You can make an appealing outfit out of just about anything. In addition, you will always have an innate knowledge of what is fashionable in the area wherever you go, allowing you to remain on top of your game no matter where you are. In fact, you'll usually be a trendsetter.


-Pegasus Aesthetics (Stargate Atlantis) (50CP)
        At any time you can apply or remove an "Ancient", "Atlantis" or "Wraith'' aesthetic to your chosen possessions and properties. The Ancient aesthetic is clean white tones with motifs cut at clean angles while the Atlantis aesthetic is blue and ochre walls and floors, clear pipes of bubbling water, with hexagonal motifs; both offer crystal-like fixture controls and flush light fittings. The Wraith aesthetic is dark biotech, dim blue lighting, webbing, and a low mist; this can be actual Hive biotech if you want, but such only replaces the framework and facade.


-Aesthetics (Anno 2070) (100CP)
        Others may be able to do what you do, but you? You make it look GOOD. Really, REALLY good. All buildings you construct now have a distinctive architectural flair that marks them as yours and yours alone. Even a simple wooden shack you build will have people nodding matter-of-factly and recognizing the design like a nation's flag, if they've had experience with you before. In addition, purely aesthetic construction - landscaped bays, parks, covered walkways, promenades - are not only cheaper to build, but require little to no upkeep.


-Aesthetics (Terraria - Journey's End) (100CP)
        It's not enough to just be able to make things, if you can't make them look good. You now have a true talent for design work and layout, capable of mentally visualizing complex structures and working out how best to match your mental vision, without sacrificing things like structural integrity. This also applies when making things on a smaller scale, allowing you to alter the design of objects to add aesthetic flare without compromising their function.


-Aesthetics and Flair (Bayonetta) (100CP)
        A gun isn't quite a gun until it LOOKS good, you know? It's supposed to be classy, make you look amazing just for having it. Likewise, that sword could use a bit of badass styling to it. When you create your weapons, you can make them look DAMNED good even on an off day. Expect any weapon creator to envy you, and those who die by your weapons to count themselves lucky as they perish to such beautiful art.


-Artiste (Girl Genius SB) (100CP)
        From acting to painting, there's a lot of call for people like you around here! Simply put, you have the skills and talent to be one of the greatest, finest artists of all time. Not just in any one field either. Your talent is boundless and unbelievable at everything remotely art-related you do. With the slightest effort, you could be a scintillating star in all fields from writing, painting, singing, underwater basket weaving... er, you get the idea. Crowds throng to listen to a concerto from you, and books you write may well cause knife fights between people wanting to buy them!
        Such is your talent that in but a handful of months you could become a celebrity every bit the equal of the Queen of the Dawn, or any other celebrity you've heard of. This also makes anything you do look unbelievably good, from your fighting which looks like a dance, to your clanks which all look like Things of Beauty and Grace even when stuffed chock-full of firepower.


-Artistic License (Everyone Else Is A Returnee) (100CP)
        You know what a gun or spear made from the body parts of a strange monster looks like? Not that great, more often than not. Luckily now you are able to make things that you create look really cool, almost like they were made from something else entirely. No matter what materials you use, you can somehow manage to make it look good. Alternatively, maybe you want to make a simple steel sword look menacing or unnatural.


-Bling of War (Macross) (100CP)
        It's one thing to have a weapon or vehicle of mass destruction, capable of rending an entire ground force or a squadron to shame. It's another to make it look so damn good your enemies would not dare get near it if they had a lick of sense. By purchasing this perk, you can design your equipment to look much more stylish and carry a 'theme' you prefer. This can range from the clothes you wear, to the weapons you wield, to even the vehicles you pilot into battle. It's all about style


-Brass and Vacuum Tubes (Smash Up) (100CP)
        You can make perfectly functional devices with a steampunk aesthetic. In fact, machines you build like this tend to work a little better, and stand up to far more abuse.


-Decadence (Dune) (100CP)
        You have the skills to sacrifice neither form nor function when you design, create, or arrange things, which is especially important in a society whose upper crust values opulence the way this society does --after all, the Emperor's throne is carved out of a single massive gemstone. Whether it's interior decorating, crafting a knife or sword, building furniture or a vehicle... you can make it appeal perfectly to the most crass or the upper crust. You can also figure out the optimal decor for any purpose or environment, which includes the best places to hide discreet surveillance devices


-Form and Function (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (100CP)
        While some scientists have to choose one or the other, you can have both; it's not only easy for you to make your works look great, but you can do so in a way where you don't use more materials than you would normally.


-Grand Aurora (Battle Through The Heavens) (100CP)
        When a treasure is born into the world, the world tends to recognise this. Special phenomena are known to occur when some particularly monumentous is created. For instance the creation of a tier 8 pill, or Tian rank Qi technique will be marked by a large unnatural phenomenon. When you complete the formation of something significant and powerful, the world recognises this. For kilometers around, people will be able to see an aurora or pillar of light and will know intuitively that something grand has been created. This can be toggled on and off as you wish.


-Heart's Desire (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (100CP)
        All Necrotects are skilled architects and designers. They wouldn't have the job if they weren't and you're no different. You're gifted with any sort of architecture, trap making or monument designing. What makes you special is that you have a sense for what your customers really want. You can picture in your mind the exact ideal of the thing they're hiring you to build and create it. Closer than any instructions could communicate to you, you understand their wish and you know what it should look like, though the construction of such a thing may yet be beyond your means. Still, if you can carry it out, they'll love you for it, even if it differs from the instructions they said to you.


-Her Majesty's Majesty (Fate/Legends - Empire of Antiquity) (100CP)
        They say that every hero of these times was a marvel to look upon. The statues that remain from these years in modern times would seem to give that impression and should you eventually have one made of you, it won't fall short. Whether it's being beautiful or handsome, you stand out like a shining jewel even among heroes. Many can't help but gasp once they see your visage and it'll smooth out plenty of problems for you, not the least is finding a suitable partner. Your beauty will also affect the things that you make and rule over, even something as large as Rome itself, but this effect slowly takes hold over time. While a sword you wield may slowly become more ornate and fine over days of use, an empire might need years to be fully affected, but it and all it's people will be shining by the end. You can have this stop at a certain level if you like, whether that's to keep some parts of your empire ugly or just to stop everyone from maybe becoming self-obsessed snobs that never stop looking in mirrors.


-Stylish Mechanic (Gurren Lagann) (100CP)
        In addition to knowing how to repair and create mechanical devices you also have quite a knack at making anything you work on look good. Any time you fix something it'll end up clean and pleasant to look at, and you can easily come up with humorous or awe-inspiring designs for vehicles and devices.


-Tailor Made (Career Model) (100CP)
        You are a brilliant designer and can ensure objects you create are always looking fantastic, aesthetically pleasing and the like. Making something look good no longer takes any time or effort- you can focus entirely on function, and whatever you make will look outstanding


-The Very Model of a Modern Major Mod (Modded Skyrim) (100CP)
        Why make something at all if it's not going to be the very best? Anything you can make, you can make breathtakingly beautiful. Whether it's a castle, a person, or even entire worlds, should you be capable of that, it will fully live up to your aesthetic expectations. What's more, you get a bit more leeway with what you can get away with before you start to have problems. That upside down pyramid can be made structurally sound, no problem.


-Top of the Class (Inception) (100CP)
        As an architect, your job is first and foremost to design. From ordinary buildings to the dreamlands visited during extraction jobs, you're a master at coming up with aesthetically pleasing environments. Even better, you're especially gifted at making the most of any unique opportunities, like improving the feel of a city when 'down' can just as easily become 'up'.


-Virtuoso (World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen) (100CP)
        There is nothing sexier than an artist. Music, painting, singing, you are a veritable virtuoso when you put your mind and faith into your work. Your emotions flow into musical pieces in ways that incite that same emotion in those that hear it. Those that look upon your art understand the deeper meanings of it almost instinctually, but it might always feel as if there is something they just can't grasp about it, something more. In some way, they can feel your divine touch by just experiencing your art.


-(Not so) Consistent Technology (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
        The average Genius has an Aesthetic that they fit into, kind of like a genre of legacy. You however, thanks to your many teachers, have a difference of opinion that makes you unique, Wonders built in your Aesthetic don't just 'feel' better but are better and you can switch your Aesthetic when you feel like a different Tech-Genre could be viable. You could have an airship that was built with the hard bulky like of a dieselpunk whilst the insides have the sleek holograms and AR of a cyberpunk.


-ABXY (Generic Video Game Developer) (200CP)
        For console games, one of the most important pieces to playing a game is the controller. It needs to fit a player's hands, it needs to have a simple button layout, and it needs to be fun to use. And you can build them without a problem. Controllers you make will more often than not be intuitive to use and have a one-size-fits-most grip that makes it not only easy to hold, but altogether enjoyable to use when playing video games. This will even extend into more advanced variations of the stock controller, allowing you to create specially made variations that offer more options for players or are fitted to make specific games easier to play.


-Accessory Machine (Spiral Knights) (200CP)
        It is one thing to go out into the world and do a Knight's duty, but it is another to look the part. This machine is special, allowing you to create cosmetic pieces or effects and bind them to your equipment to improve their appearance, though this requires resources. Nothing really comes free, after all. Armor pieces, auras, or even cosmetic wings... go ahead. Express yourself. Let your creativity flow.


-Beauty in the Arts (God of War) (200CP)
        The Greeks and their gods have an eye for the aesthetics of their surroundings. Whether it is the statues around them, or the floors they walk upon, or the things they carry and wield, it is better if it is appealing. Your ability to design any of your crafts has increased with this knowledge, able to appeal to form without sacrificing function. Regardless of what you create, it's going to look good enough that the gods might take notice... might. Whether this is a good thing, or a bad thing is for you to decide.


-Cannith Contemporary (D&D Eberron) (200CP)
        House Cannith controls the crafting, but they aren't the only crafters out there. Thanks either to your raw skill or to skilled networking, you gain connections and reputation with other crafters much faster, and can add fancy and unusual flairs to anything you make.


-Devilish Details (Dungeon Keeper) (200CP)
        While dark and dank may suffice for the common rabble, great Keepers require suitably grandiose lodgings to show off their wealth and power. Make doing so easier by acquiring the ability to slowly alter any property you own to better reflect your personality. Watch colors slowly shift to match your preference and fixtures become personalized in shape and form. The effect is only skin deep, so while a poorly constructed home may look impressive, it's still as rotten on the inside as its owner.


-From Q With Love (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Taser in the keyfob, laser in the watch, grappling hook pistol that looks like a cellphone? You are the undisputed master at disguising weapons and espionage gear as ordinary items. Just try not to get them confused with the real thing, and do bring the car back in pristine condition.


-Perfected Calligraphy (Exalted - The Infernals) (200CP)
        Elloge is a writer and storyteller without peer, ever creating within herself new vortices of vocalization and tangles of text. Her inner worlds reflecting manifold different tales and countless chapters of her own narratives. The deepest parts of her have little to do with reality as it is or ever was, idealized paradises and grand dramas unfolding in realms that resemble Creation, Malfeas, lost Zen-Mu, or any number of other, fictional worlds. So too may you craft elaborate narratives and uniquely beautiful stories, ever writing with the zeal of inspiration, and muse-born linguistics that would stand out even in the countless annals and libraries of Hell. From now on, you shall live and breathe the ingenuity of a talecrafter without peer. Appropriately to the wondrous correspondences you shall write, you will also gain the calligraphic skill to write with neat flowing script or ornate glyphs in all the numberless languages of the Sphere of Speech.


-Artisan of the Supreme Holy Heavens (Against the Gods!) (300CP)
        While a huge part of everything, cultivation is not all there is to life. There are things to enjoy too, such as arts and beauty. This perk gives you exemplary, extreme talent for arts of all kind. Anything you do, you can do unbelievably beautifully and artistically.
        And those words really do mean just that. A casual scribble from your fingers would have people paying absurd sums in auctions for it, singing a couple notes could inflame a whole new musical movement worldwide, and something you put actual effort into could drive people into rapturous adoration simply by encountering it. This works in every field of art, from writing to drawing to singing and dancing, and you can even train it to further improve things.


-Ancient But High Tech (Cities of the World) (600CP)
        You are an expert in making advanced technology out of lower tech items, and of integrating technology seamlessly into society. Technologies you introduce will be less disruptive and be adopted easier, and are harder to replicate. Not only that, but you've become a virtual genius in making technological items look like nothing of the kind. Scanners that look like mirrors, tables that are computers, stone idols that are forcefield generators. Of course, this makes you extremely good at spotting when others have done exactly the same thing and working out how such devices operate.
        As a city, your people are well versed in such integration of form and function, able to seem quaint and harmless while being nothing of the kind. People will constantly underestimate your people as being uneducated hicks and rubes who can't possibly be advanced as modern folks... though this effect isn't enforced and if you show it to be wrong too often, more intelligent people will learn otherwise. Any area under your influence will accept new technology and innovations extremely rapidly and with a minimum of fuss.


-Bring it to Life (Generic Video Game Developer) (600CP)
        Your art is transcendent in more ways than one. Any artistic design that you make is like a story of its own, each drawing worth a thousand words and every expression displaying the exact emotion you intended. Your ability is such that you can make drawings that could be mistaken for photographs, even when inspected by experts, and any animation you make is smooth, aesthetically pleasing, and looks natural. Nearly anything you make, even those drawn on a napkin in just under a minute, are so awe inspiring that that napkin drawing could inspire an entire franchise if shown to the right people.


-Legendary Master: Artistic (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert at expressing the inner beauty of any medium. It is mere childsplay to make anything you manufacture fit an aesthetic theme, regardless of function. Any dedicated statues, paintings, sketches etc. you make are vastly improved in quality, regardless of what you actual used or created. A water-colour paint-by-numbers on old parchment showing a gerbil giving birth would still possess beauty if filled by you. Also allows you to find a market for your artwork in any setting, allowing you decent income based upon quality of work. If there exists no parties to purchase such things, I'll buy them. Put them right up on my cosmic fridge.


-Lucid Logo Designer (City of Angles) (600CP)
        Design, iterate, redesign. Undo. A different approach. When it comes to graphic design, you certainly have an eye for aesthetic that can't be beat. But your best work is done without a specific goal in mind, idle adjustments to a logo intended for nothing in particular. As time passes, you'll note that it starts to look less and less like a logo at all. And indeed, it isn't. What you are pulling from the depths of your subconscious and laying on the page is a map, an ever-growing and ever-more-detailed guide to the structure of reality itself, no matter how odd that reality might be. In time, you could put the entirety of the City of Angles to paper.


-Mural Inspiration | The Yellow Sign (City of Angles) (800CP)
        Mural Inspiration (200CP)
        Graffiti is an oft-maligned craft, a generally illegal one at that. And sure, the lawmakers have their reasons, but you're not some lamer throwing up tags on the bathroom walls. No, your art has a message. What message? Well, that's up to you. Regardless, when people see your art, or your icon, or your words scrawled on public facades, that message will shine through loud and clear. And if they're amenable to the message, who knows? Maybe it will inspire them to action, to go above and beyond.
        The Yellow Sign (600CP)
        Now this is a trick with a rather more...specific meaning. Not to mention a lot more vitriol. Normal graffiti is the stylization of words, to make sure the right people can read it. This is the opposite: a single word, filled with love for those you care about, and hatred for those who would do them harm, carefully constructed so that only the latter group can comprehend it. When they do, the message encoded within takes its love and its hatred, and forms a spike of righteous fury that slams through their cerebral cortex. In a single moment, excuses, justifications, and rationalizations for their misdeeds are stripped away. Depending on just how many misdeeds they've committed, they might be given pause, reel in horror, or even break entirely under the weight of their past actions.




 --- Domain: Quality: Design (32) (21 Perks) --- 




-Artistic Architect (Halo - Forerunner Saga) (100CP)
        Forerunner structures are not simple. Even in the worst of times, there is a beauty to their layout. Patterns woven into walls, shining pillars reaching to the sky, and shimmering glass panes adjourning corridors. Forerunners don't just build big. They build artfully. Like so many other Builders, you have an eye, and a hand, for beauty in construction. From the most simple of floors, to the most terrifying of weapons, you can spruce them up so that they are breathtaking to behold.


-Customized Weapons (XCOM) (100CP)
        You know that efficiency is number one, because waste is a thief. You know how to make the best designs better, and will ensure that the equipment in use is ergonomic, streamlined, and efficient.


-Hull Architect (Endless Space) (100CP)
        You know how to design ships. From nose to engine, you could draft up a functional space worthy ship. On paper. Putting all the pieces together maybe beyond you, but anyone who puts it together will agree, it's a mighty fine ship


-My Watch Doesn't Tell Time (Honkai Impact Third) (100CP)
        The further you stray from the intended use of a device's style or look the better a device it becomes by default. If you make a watch that can't tell time you could cram a ton of things into it despite it's relatively tiny size. The shape or style must be a recognized thing, like a watch or a phone in order to benefit from the boost.


-Survey (Green Worldz) (100CP)
        A simple little survey that, when filled out, reveals the ideal weapon parameters for any given individual. The default length is 239 questions, but the survey becomes longer and more comprehensive as your crafting skills and resources become more diverse. As long as a person fills out the survey truthfully (and they are compelled to do so when faced with this version), the resulting weapon will be a truly one-of-a-kind tool perfectly matched to their personality and fighting style.


-Weapon Modifications (Archer) (100CP)
        You design and modify weapons with flair, creativity, and skill.


-Wired Watchmaker (Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura) (100CP)
        Long hours hunched over the machinery and books that define your profession have left you with a keen eye for detail. Your eyesight is excellent even in the occasionally poorly-lit workshops you frequent, and your mind has sharpened to the point you'll easily remember the details of any schematic you're trying to assemble. You can still wear that monocle of course, but this time, you'll wear it for style!


-ARTIFICER (PREY) (200CP)
        Any monkey with a wrench can look up the technical manual and do a repair. Well, maybe not any monkey, but you're certainly a cut above the rest. Any technology you come across that you understand the principles behind can be drastically improved. Either simplifying it to make it easier to fabricate or improving its durability or power output. Weapons, turrets, tools and vehicles can all be improved beyond their base specs.


-Infinitely Customizable (Dead Space) (200CP)
        It's not that your guns are bad, by any stretch of the imagination, it's just that they could be so, so much better. And now you can actually do that. In this world, tools and weapons are aided by nano-scale circuitry, which leaves a lot of room for improvement, typically in the form of power nodes being welded into specific places to provide extra power to certain subsystems of the weapon, to increase power output, ammo count/efficiency, and even unlock special abilities, like setting enemies on fire, or exploding violently. As an added benefit, you also get the ability to break weapons and tools down into parts - specifically frames, tools, tips, accessories, and upgrade chips, see the Notes section for more information - and reconfigure them to your liking. You can even upgrade those parts individually using power nodes.


-Lab Standards (Starbound) (200CP)
        You are comfortable around technology. You can deduce what complex machines do, at least as far as scientific principles go, and once you understand them, you can standardize them. Technology that you study can be converted into generic versions which may be weaker or less versatile but are easier to maintain and produce. You also can follow the most complicated techno-jargon as if it was plain English.


-Engineer (Super Mario RPG) (300CP)
        You're more adept at coming up with novel and creative objects. Any blueprint can be held perfectly in your mind without needing to draw it on paper.


-Counter Technology (A Certain Magical Index + A Certain Scientific Railgun) (400CP)
        Some powers or technology have weaknesses and especially those Esper abilities have one and you made this into an art on your own. You have a preternatural ability to create and invent technology to counter and neutralize any powers or technology that you have encountered or have enough knowledge off and make them powerless and useless. So long the powers or technology that you want to neutralize is running the same system, using the same element or working in the same principles your counters will work with all of them without problems. The technologies that you built are impossible to reverse-engineer without your consent even using magic or forcefully analyzing it through technology even if they are trillions of years more advanced than yours.


-Enhancement Mastery (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (400CP)
        Just by looking at a piece of technology you are able to consider different ways on how it might be improved. Whether its increasing damage for weapons or decreasing power draw for components there is always some way to improve an item. This also improves your Valkyrie's Core innate ability to enhance items.


-Innovator (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (400CP)
        It's a pain, isn't it? Seeing all these people who just don't seem to realize how much they can do with their incredible powers. Well, that's not something you need to worry about, at least. You have an incredible imagination, coupled with a ridiculous degree of technical capability. You're able to come up with new uses for practically anything and everything you see, from jutsu to seals.
        Whatever it is, you just seem to 'know' how to apply them in all sorts of clever, innovative ways to achieve great results. This is only a side-advantage though. Your real skill lies in playing around with the techniques and abilities themselves. You have a ridiculously great ability to modify, break down and recreate any and all techniques, be they Taijutsu, Genjutsu, Ninjutsu or even specific bloodline applications.
        You don't actually learn them any faster but once you have learned them your mind unleashes a veritable flood of ideas for improving them, applying them in ways no one has ever thought of, boosting their power or broadness though simple tricks, merging disparate techniques, lifting principles and elements from one and applying them to the other, coming up with new variants... and these are just a few examples of what you can do to them. If it still needs to be said, this also massively advances your ability to come up with new tricks and techniques, and lets you easily combo any already-compatible skills and abilities for maximum synergy.


-Modular Designs (Dead Space) (400CP)
        It's always easier to make better things from better materials, and your knowledge of far-future engineering is top-notch, meaning that all of the things you make are all that much better for it. Aside from being able to upgrade parts, tools, and weapons further, and make better base parts for tools and weapons, you can apply the bonuses of Infinitely Customizable to things other than tools and weapons, breaking anything down into classes of modular parts and swapping them around to your heart's content. This nearly obviates every part of the process of retro-fitting older creations with newer parts, aside from the actual manual labor and time.


-Modularity (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        Hardware incompatibilities are a pain to deal with. Thankfully, you design your stuff to connect together like Lego pieces. You know just how to design and create hardware that is capable of being put together piece by piece rather easily, allowing you to create consoles that can have internal parts replaced like a PC. You can also design your stuff so that it can hold a host of attachments, like a VR headset that connects to your controller or a console with a built-in charging station. If you want to keep adding more and more, that's just what you can do now.


-Schizo-tech Expert (Arcanum: Of Steamworks And Magick Obscura) (400CP)
        Technology advances in leaps and bounds, which may leave the enterprising inventor with some compatibility issues. After all, upgrading the old model of steam-powered Automaton with an electromagnetic hydraulics system may give it the dexterity to paint works of art as much as cleave your foes in half, but that's hardly a success if the optical systems receive interference and rend your servitor blind! You've become exceedingly adept at integrating multiple kinds of technology, especially when the various parts would normally be incompatible. Using different energy sources, blending outdated design principles with the latest advancements of the future and more are all within your grasp. Incredible!


-The Next Step (DOOM 3) (400CP)
        The UAC is pushing the boundaries of known science, and it's no wonder that a lot of the Mars facilities are dedicated to cutting-edge and somewhat poorly tested technologies. After all, testing how exactly things work is one of the reasons we do science! That said, there's no reason not to push for the best possible results right from the start, and you embody this ideal and then some. You have become highly adept at developing prototype systems incorporating new fields of science, to the point your initial designs are usually as good as (if not better) than those others might come up with after two or three rounds of testing, debugging and fine-tuning. Likewise, you can glean far greater insights from any such development cycles you implement, meaning that this 'head start' is only going to get bigger the more time you put into your R&D. This Perk grants you a 50CP stipend which you may use in the UAC Equipment Catalog section found later in this document.


-Weaponization (Mega Man Classic) (400CP)
        Your understanding of machines is such that, given an ordinary lumber-cutting robot, you can easily rebuild and reprogram minor worker robots into trained fighters. A lumber-cutting robot becomes a dangerous axeman, and the equivalent of the average Joe for a robot turns into a deadly sniper. In general you are capable of making machines more powerful while retooling them to suit your purpose. That pipe dream of turning a workforce into an army isn't too far fetched now.


-Making Virtual a Reality (Generic Video Game Developer) (600CP)
        First came the controller, then much later motion sensing, and later still Virtual Reality, with the future holding untold possibilities. But not for long. You have the ability to design and create just about any kind of hardware imaginable, with such marvels as game controllers that shape themselves to their user's hands or real life holodecks being well within your grasp should you have enough time. This works beyond the scope of video game technology, as well, allowing you to make things like computerized fans that turn on above a set temperature, or things like self- driving cars.


-The Legacy of /m/ (World Seed) (600CP)
        Looks like you've watched a few too many anime of a previous century. Or too few, depending on who you ask. Nevertheless, seeing several mechas combine into one giant mecha has inspired you to develop a certain skill set, one that allowed you to take the concept of combination and run with it. As long as you have the time and resources, you can easily build things such as several spaceships that combine into one large mecha able to fight space monsters in melee, with its pilots linking their minds to fight as one, that will be far stronger than the sum of its parts. If you ever come upon a race with collective chuunibyou, I'm sure you'd find many friends in them.
        You can also build similar technology that is smaller in scale, like for example autonomously fighting swords that combine together for a devastating final attack, or something as advanced as nanite swarms able to transform into almost anything you could possibly conceive of. Furthermore, with some work you could also combine devices that weren't designed to do so, taking their best parts but leaving out their individual flaws to make something exponentially more powerful or useful than either of the originals.
        Somehow, you are able to do this without the end product ending up any larger, clunkier, or needing more energy. So making the most powerful gun you are able to build, but which uses up an inordinate amount of energy, and combining it with the most energy efficient one in your arsenal is a real possibility open to you.




 --- Domain: Quality: Durability (33) (29 Perks) --- 




-The Honed Edge (Pocky & Rocky) (100CP)
        With just a bit of time and polish you can restore any blade to its true sharpness, as if it were just crafted. Rust and tarnish to away with ease as well. Your tools and weapons are always in the best shape. SOME effort does need to be put into this care of course.


-Whether There's Weather (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (100CP)
        If you built or designed it, it's weatherproof. What kind of weather? Yes. Snow, scorching heat, pouring rain, vacuum, hail, all sorts of weather. If a human could survive a while without a spacesuit, you tech will keep working. And maybe it'll keep working even if a human couldn't.


-Brush Guard (Generic Zombie Apocalypse) (200CP)
        Your equipment or vehicles will never be damaged or have its functionality impaired due to being used as a weapon against organic targets.


-Crude and Tough (Warframe SB) (200CP)
        While Grineer technology is ugly and primitive compared to their rivals, they are undoubtedly effective, rugged and easily produced. The latter is true for creations of your craft. Anything you make is both durable and tough, able to take a beating and function in the harshest of environments while being viable for mass production.


-Designing for the Armageddon (Empire from the Ashes) (200CP)
        Is a valuable skill, to those who understand such things. You have a certain gift, my friend. Whenever interacting with any kind of system, you have a preternatural understanding for designing things to be impossibly rugged and long-lasting. Be it computers, machines or even institutions, you always know the right redundancies, designs and methodologies to use, resulting in systems that can stand the test of time almost indefinitely. They might not rise very much further by themselves with just this, but anything you have a hand in creating will last for veritable aeons, practically indefinitely unless someone specifically and deliberately acts to destroy them, and even then they'd have excellent odds of surviving.


-ELDER TECHNOLOGY (The Culture Minds) (200CP)
        Some civs just build to last, and it is not unusual for Sublimed civs to leave considerable artifacts behind. Any technological device, structure or vehicle that you create has an effectively unlimited usable lifespan. Not even organic matter that is a part of the device will decay, or even undergo effects like proton decay over the aeons. They will still need expendable reserves a gun still needs bullets, a laser still needs its power pack replaced or recharged but that gun's moving parts never wear out, and that rechargeable power pack can be reused for aeons and more without loss of performance.


-German Engineering (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Everything you build seems just a bit more. More durable, more efficient, more precise. Call it a 10-20% difference across the board?


-Mythril Coating (Final Fantasy Dissidia) (200CP)
        In many realms throughout the rift, mythril has always been an element of reputable worth. With the powers of the rift however, this mythril coating has been charged somewhat. Able to be applied onto both weapons and armor, items coated with this will be constantly charged with magical energy. As a consequence of this, the affected item allows one to sustain energy draining forms for twice as long, and improves their power slightly.


-Reliable Invention (Kim Possible) (200CP)
        Anything you construct is only broken when used improperly or purposefully targeted with attacks. The items you create do not malfunction and are completely resistant to damage caused by regular usage.


-Technical Knock (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (200CP)
        You have mastered the ancient technical rite of 'if it doesn't work, smack it with a wrench until it does.' Small problems like loose gears can be quickly and permanently fixed with one good whack. When a larger problem impedes a machine's function, continuous pounding and irate prayer can cajole it to miraculously perform one last, brief task, but no more. At that point, this rite will have no more effect until the device receives proper attention.


-Tinker (Generic Builder) (200CP)
        You have a knack for creating things with complex moving parts that don't break down given 'normal' wear and tear. Toys could last generations with just a little care, a roller-coaster wouldn't break down unless someone sabotaged it or it was struck by lightning or some other external force.


-Built to Last (Assassin's Creed) (300CP)
        Whatever you personally build, be it handheld or architectural, becomes nigh-impervious to weather, rust and time. If it gets lost or buried, you can 'feel' it out too!


-Built To Last (Stargate Atlantis) (300CP)
        You probably took the saying if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well a little too closely to heart. You could build a city to last tens of thousands of years at full functionality or a battery that keeps its unused charge indefinitely. Mere time and weather will not erode your monuments, and your devices may lie dormant for eons, ready to reawaken at any time. It's up to you whether this is due to glowy space crystals (ahem, advanced materials science knowledge) or something stranger.


-Robust Engineering (Dune) (300CP)
        Ten thousand years of stagnation in technology is a very long time... and now you know how to apply the lessons of those millennia to the construction of anything you have. Mass production does not exist any longer and even relatively common items are made as if masterwork quality, because aside from obvious cheap items, they have been built to last longer than the person using them. Expect anything you construct by hand to be able to last centuries, as long as you take a little extra time while you make it. With the amount of time you're going to be around... you may need that sort of quality.


-A Monument to Time Itself (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (400CP)
        You built things to last. A monument to death that itself dies may have a certain appeal to more philosophical sorts but you wanted your monuments to last for eternity, so that everyone would look upon them and know the glories that your mind had wrought. What objects or structures you create, by your own hand or by your direction, will last forever. The passage of time and the environment around it will not degrade it or damage it or destroy it. Even blows against it, attempts to demolish what you have made, will see their blades break long before the stone you laid down does. Your creations are imbued with supernatural durability, though they will not last forever or be protected against anything, they will be proof against mere mortals trying to defile your art.


-Armsthrift (Fire Emblem: Awakened) (400CP)
        Your weapons just don't seem to break and you know how to care for them well. Even immensely fragile things are unlikely to break in your care. Guns won't jam and swords never lose their edge


-Built to Last (Nexus 2.0) (400CP)
        The things you create are much more resilient than they otherwise would be, requiring far less maintenance to keep in good condition and functional. This even applies to larger projects, such as buildings and farms, or more esoteric creations, such as Seeds for Seed Sorcery. On top of this, anything you build is simply built better, a sword will hold a sharper edge, armor will resist more damage, a cart will have a smoother ride, and much more.


-Chimerical Genius (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        The science of cybernetic augmentation is quite mature in this day and age, and you are at the forefront of combining flesh with machine. The cybernetics you design and install are not only top-of-the-line in terms of their function and performance, but are also very aesthetically pleasing, either matching the contours of the body or in startling contrast. The parts you could build are so durable that they are quite likely to survive long past the person they are attached to: even under such an assault where the flesh is unrecognizable, the chimeric parts you installed would still likely be useable to the degree of being able to install them into another person. You may not be quite at the notorious level of Dr Trintingent, but if you've been a doctor for long, it's likely you have a small following of fans of your work among the chimeric demographic.


-Form & Function (Final Fantasy XIV) (400CP)
        A while back, you overheard something your customers had said - about cloth and leather being insufficient to protect them out in the wilderness of Eorzea. You have to admit that they do have a bit of a point. Cloth and leather might be far more comfortable than a suit of plate armor, but functionally they protect substantially less. But maybe if you could use a different material, things might be different?
        The principle of this weave is the same as when you made inner linings. But whereas inner linings allowed you to split open layers in order to weave enchantments and magic inside, now you have folded layer upon layer with inlaid crystals to attain a weave that can withstand blows just as well as a suit of plate might. The amount of crystals you need for the process is substantial - but the magic is ultimately necessary, so that you don't leave a single imperfection which may ruin the final product, and also so that it doesn't end up looking bulky and cumbersome.
        Objects that you craft with the same principle exhibit durability several times stronger than what you would have expected from an equivalent of similar weight.


-Made of Nintendium (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        Nintendium, the master material, the adamantium of the gaming world! Exaggeration it might be, you do make people guess twice with how physically durable your creations are. Your consoles could survive being dropped from the top shelf, your phones could be stepped on without issue. Heck, taking a sledgehammer to something made by you might even leave something salvageable, if you put enough work in. Oh, was that not mentioned? The more time you spend designing something, the more durable you'll be able to make it without too much of a limit.


-Never Goes Out Of Style (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        Sometimes old technology is not quite as irrelevant as people would like to think it is. Fission can be useful in the far future, and ground combat is never quite completely irrelevant. You have an incredible talent for finding new uses for old technology. Things you build are incredibly robust and resilient, while remaining extremely adaptable and amenable to being modified to suit new purposes. One thing the Graysons excelled in was environmental systems to stave off the harshness of their world's environment. You have an excellent working knowledge of their design, production, and maintenance. One might even develop domed cities.


-Plague Hardening (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        In the years post-Melding, much of the advanced technology of the Belle poque has been set aside due to the risk of infection with Melding Plague spores. Where once glittering near-autonomous volantors streaked through Chasm City's skies, now steam- and battery-driven cars grind along its streets. Where buildings could be grown from a seed and altered at their owner's whims, now they must be painstakingly built with labor. You, however, have developed strains of plague-hardened nanotech. Any advanced technology you build is vastly more resistant to the ever-evolving Melding Plague and similar viral and infectious agents which seek to subvert it, lasting for days or weeks of direct exposure before succumbing when a similar unprotected machine might fail in minutes or seconds. And when your technology's defenses are finally broken, it 'petrifies', dumbing down its present form and function rather than growing wild and further spreading the plague; able to continue being used for a more limited application rather than failing outright. For example, an infected fabricator might reduce its construction resolution to components larger than one millimeter, losing its ability to produce micro-scale items but still able to be used, rather than churning out a froth of contagious plague spores.


-Applied Phlebotinum (Honkai Impact Third) (600CP)
        You see that dumb dangerous energy over there? Yeah. You can build your machines to harness it. Most of the time. You're a master of unconventional sources of power for your devices, and the weirder and more dangerous it is, the stronger the resulting power is. If you could somehow hook a Herrscher into your generators you'd substantially amplify their power output to the point you could probably use a single one to make a continent destroying weapon. Just beware of the potential Phlebotinum breakdown. Please don't put any big red self destruct buttons on it.


-Extended Warranty (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        Let's get real for a second: You are a scientist, not a repair monkey. You shouldn't have to teleport all the way from your home planet to fix something one of your assistants managed to break in the time you took your eyes off of them. As a result, your technology is now durable and long-lasting...you can go years without seeing a prototype of your creation before it actually needs you to fix it directly, even the most idiotic and primitive species being able to guesswork how to fix it even if they don't know how it works. Also when I say durable, I mean the universe could collapse into nothingness and that device of yours would still be floating in the empty void that used to be said universe. Point being, technology you create is both insanely durable and is easily maintained. Now maybe you don't have to handle everything yourself.


-Failess Mode (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
        When you design equipment or machinery, you make sure that it's designed properly. Your designs are far more resilient against failure than they would otherwise be, only completely failing when critical components are outright destroyed. Chain reactions where failure of one component leads to another failing are uncommon, and really can't happen by accident. More importantly, every failure mode is a safe failure mode. You could make an antimatter storage container that wouldn't auto-annihilate if power failed.


-Lost Arts (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (600CP)
        The Cabiri form of the Great Rite would appear and disappear, be destroyed and appear again no matter how hard Horus tried. Now your works are similarly hard to erase. Any of your creations, from writings to paintings to swords are immune to the ravages of time and have a mysterious luck of their own. This luck causes your creations to avoid destruction time and time again though all kinds of contrivances and circumstances.


-Performance Optimization (Ragnarok Online) (600CP)
        Every adventurer has seen their weapons start to degrade and eventually it ends in a trip to the blacksmith with their weapons broken. For a Blacksmith, it only takes so many weapons before they would come to consider What if we could make a weapon perform well regardless of what condition was it in? Reaching a breakthrough was a matter of reworking what Blacksmiths already had. Rather than looking to boost the performance cap of a weapon, Blacksmiths looked instead to boost the performance lifespan: Concluding with the creation of a spell which will keep the weapon intact regardless of physical and magical trauma for as long as it is maintained.


-Steamflogger of the Century (MtG - Bablovia) (600CP)
        You are one of the greatest riggers the plane has ever seen. You assemble contraption like it was nothing, building one crazy machinery after the other. More often than not, your contraptions are so sophisticated that even despite using sub par material, these machines will never stop working. Also, you have a knack for building contraptions that build new contraptions themselves. Just don't cause them to take over the world by accident!


-The Test of Time (World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen) (600CP)
        Whether it was your job to place a single type of gem within the soil, to create a certain mineral, or to carve mountains that reach the sky, your works were never meant to deplete. Change form, perhaps, but never lessen from what they were. You remember the secrets of creation you once wielded long ago. When you create something from raw materials with your own hands and infuse it with your Faith, it becomes something far more than what it is. Though a sword will bend, it will never shatter. Though it may burn white with heat, it will never melt. What is that sword-shaped thing in that black hole? Your work of art, of course! As long as there is no automation or outside assembly, anything you create becomes infused with divine might and will never wear or break. A leather jacket you made an animal's hide might be able to catch a sabot round, but that does not mean it won't splatter the person wearing it.




 --- Domain: Quality: Efficiency (34) (66 Perks) --- 




-Creative Leaps (Lords Of The Night - Liches) (100CP)
        You might not be as good at putting in the work, or checking all the steps, or keeping up with the research. What you can do, is make wild leaps that are consistent with what you know, jump to simpler solutions, and causally realize more elegant approaches to what seems like complex problems. A smarter mind than yours might figure out what actually has to happen to solve a problem. But seeing that solution, you can jump to how to do the same thing in a tenth as many steps, as you figure out how one action can solve two problems, and set you up to cleanly execute the next step. And your solution will be more robust to boot. You're also more intuitive, able to pick up and realize things without ever knowing why you picked them up or realized them, and more creative in general.


-Efficient Electricity (Generic Video Game Developer) (100CP)
        Energy. Computers, being devices able to calculate AI paths while simultaneously rendering graphics for players to see, use a decent amount of it. Thankfully, you seem to be extra skilled in the area of computer electronics, able to make devices that not only use smaller amounts of energy for the same work, but are also more resilient than the average gaming device, able to handle electrical surges far better than most.


-REMODELLING (Medaka Box Abnormal) (100CP)
        Why be satisfied with just what you were born with when you can make improvements? Through a variety of methods of experimentation, you are able to directly improve the power and efficiency of living beings or inanimate objects by remodelling them. This can be as simple as making an animal not afraid of powerful people or as complex as turning someone into a powerful cyborg or bringing out latent Abnormal or Minus powers within your own brain, given you can use Remodelling on yourself just as easily. There's not much of a limit on how much you can improve someone but it will take more and more resources the crazier and stronger the changes you are making are.
        * Keep in mind the crazy and strong changes are comparative to a world with reality warping conceptual powers galore


-Savant (Family Matters) (100CP)
        There is some area of endeavor in which you are truly brilliant. This could be Waldo's talent for cooking, a particular sport, music, or any other real world skillset. You have the talent to be among the very best in the world, if you put in the work, and will achieve that status in far less time than most. This perk can be purchased multiple times


-Spanner Hand (Revelation Space) (100CP)
        You're very good at fixing things...and, it has to be said, breaking them as well. You've a keen eye for the right places on a machine to do some damage; load-bearing supports, sensor clusters, stress bands in the hull. But the reverse still holds: when it comes to up-armoring something, reinforcing it, and ironing out any weaknesses, you'll find the optimal placement for those, too.


-Technical Expertise (Iji) (100CP)
        You're pretty damn impressive when it comes to all sorts of technical applications. With this, you can better modify your own weaponry, armor and augmentations. Or just be creative and accomplish tasks like rigging an elevator to catapult it's occupants into the ceiling, turning them into paste. Fun.


-The Right Tools (Generic Cyberpunk) (100CP)
        They can be hard to find, but when resources are hoarded and hard to come by you've learned to make do. You can easily improvise for tools and materials you lack by creatively using what you do have, even if that means using scrap to build the tools to build the tools you need. Even if you're lucky enough to have a fully stocked workshop or lab this will come in handy, as you'll be able to do a great deal more with what you have instead of needing to commission or build specialized equipment for every unique little thing. You'll never be empty handed and useless for long.


-Artist's Eye (Inception) (200CP)
        You've always had a keen attention to detail, but it's about more than just sight. Smells, sounds, if anything the dreams are defined by how they feel. Your skill at paying attention to the minutiae of your environment not only allow you to craft more intricate dreamlands for others to enter, it also lets you spot the details that truly matter. To some, an elevator is just a means to get from one floor to the next, even in the dream. For you? You might realize just what each of those floors represents, and how important it is that you know just what lies within someone's subconscious...


-Excellent Craftsman (In Another World With My Smartphone) (200CP)
        You are incredibly talented at making things. What kinds of things? All kinds of things. You are simply that talented after all. Anything you personally make, or direct the creation of, will automatically be top-quality, and you never need to worry about making mistakes in the creation process. To get you started you may pick any four mundane skills related to making things, which you start as a master of.


-Facile Frivolity (Rimworld) (200CP)
        You know just how to use excess resources. This may seem somewhat oxymoronic but whenever you possess a surplus of goods, be it food, medicine, or some crafting good, you will know exactly how best to put it to use. Maybe an extra half centimeter of plasteel insulation will make it so your lightbulbs never burn out! Progress!


-Fixer Upper (Dark Cloud 2) (200CP)
        When they put you through an apprenticeship, the first thing they did was to tell you to take apart a train. Then put it back together again. Then they repeated the process, removing parts bit by bit, and yet every time you still managed to put the train back together. Eventually you've come to realize that you can repair things - all while removing any extraneous parts to ensure that the efficiency of a machine is optimized. Machines that you've tinkered with don't seem to need as much to work as others might.


-Heart of Fire (Nexus 2.0) (200CP)
        Fire Elementals possess a form of magic called the Ember. This magic grants incredible resistance, bordering on immunity, to heat and flames, though it does nothing for the pain that heat can cause. However, that is merely a side effect. The true use of Ember is as a form of refinement, materials exposed to ember infused flame have their traits enhanced. Food becomes tastier and more nutritious, metals become more resilient, and potions last longer or have an increased effect. This does, however, require the material to be exposed to flame, so this will not work on certain materials.


-Innovator (Final Fantasy XIV) (200CP)
        You'll never make a name for yourself if you can't innovate - and sometimes, innovation requires you to take risks and make mistakes, even ones which might be catastrophic. It takes effort to gain experience, and it takes courage to put in effort - but you've also got a bit of beginner's luck whenever you start trying to produce something new. You're far more likely to succeed - and consequently far less likely to fail if you go in completely blind, but more importantly than that, you're not likely to come up with a completely useless product in the end.


-Insightful Analysis (Freefall) (200CP)
        Whenever you build, invent, scan, design, or perform a major repair on something, you have a clear and accurate understanding of it several decades in advance. The errors, issues, bugs, problems and so on that would be discovered with mass production and mass use of whatever item are clearly understood by you, alongside the fixes and preventative measures that would come into play.


-Master of the Forge (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (200CP)
        You are a master at crafting everything from simple items to masterwork weapons. You need to devote considerable time to each individual item, but the resulting masterpiece will always be superior to a normal version of that item. You also know how to enchant your works with special enchantments, whether blessings that strengthen you in battle or curses that corrupt you.


-Nanocataylst Augmentation (Crysis) (200CP)
        The Nanosuit and it's successor was reverse-engineered from Ceph technology, and retained it's compatibility with their technology, beyond simple common protocols. It was also able to take in fragments of Ceph technology to decipher advances and take aboard specialized nanomaterials for its own use, making it stronger. This technique can also be applied to other types of equipment or symbiont, enabling them to take aboard fragments of other similar pieces of equipment to improve their capabilities. 'Similar' refers to technologies within the same general category. Rifles, Ceph Hardware, technology derived from a specific civilization and so on. Items may belong to multiple categories at once.


-Quick Seed (Nexus 2.0) (200CP)
        Seeds are normally slow to grow, with more Light potentially cracking it open and wasting the effort. Sapphire goblins, however, have taken what many would consider a hazard and turned it into an art. Any Seed formed by a sapphire goblin is more stable, able to be pushed farther before it breaks open, allowing them to build them up faster. Additionally, in moments of need, a sapphire goblin can overload a Seed, holding it together just long enough to overpower it, before they let it break to use the Seed at a much higher power than normal.


-Well-Forged (Assassin's Creed Odyssey) (200CP)
        A misthios lives and dies by the quality of their weapons, and you have a particular edge in that department. All of your weapons and armor will remain in top condition with minimal maintenance, and you instinctively know how to take care of what little maintenance they do need. What's more, your weapons and armor will improve as you do. As you train and become stronger, your weapons will become that much sharper, your armor that much harder, without you needing to do anything beyond training or fighting. This effect can extend to non-violent tools as well.


-Wonder Forging Genius (Generic Exalted) (200CP)
        Your crafting abilities need to be seen to be believed. From your hands pour forth miracles given form, works of art of peerless and breathtaking magnificence, works of culinary delight that would leave Emperors sullen at the thought that no other foods could compare, weapons that could last hundreds of years of constant use that would leave men feeling honored to have been slain by them, all these and more take shape under the guidance of your hands. You would be welcomed in any land and by any court for the sheer quality of your work, and you will quickly gain national, if not worldwide, fame for your creations if you bother to advertise them at all.
        The least of your creations are superior to anything a mortal master might create, and even the simplest and least adorned of your works will be possessed of unmatched efficiency, resilience, and simple elegance.
        Purchased with the Savant perk this is taken to an even grander height, leaving even the crafts of other Exalted looking as pale and shameful imitations by comparison, assuming you put forth the same effort they did in learning your base crafting abilities.


-Deity's Weapon | Weapon Synthesis (Warriors Orochi) (300CP)
        Deity's Weapon (100CP)
        Naturally, your aura is not your only tool, and neither is it just for show. By imbuing a portion of your aura into a tool, you can turn it into a weapon capable of eating through physical and magical barriers alike. Naturally, as you're infusing a portion of your mystic nature into the tool, with time it will grow to possess magical qualities as well. With a sufficient amount of time passing, you could very well find yourself bearing a mystic weapon, one that has naturally absorbed enough mystic force to rival the greatest of magical weapons. With enough time, all that energy would be enough to make it a weapon of lore. Just don't expect it to happen anytime soon.
        Weapon synthesis (200CP)
        Out there in the Dimensional World, you might not be able to find a blacksmith, in which case, it would probably be good to learn the skill yourself. Forging a spear or a sword? Well anybody can learn that from any blacksmith, here we're going to teach you how to perform weapon synthesis. Yes, it's not blacksmithing as you would expect. So, that weapon of yours. It looks completely serviceable, right? Battle worthy probably, probably killed off great swathes of foot soldiers? There's no need to sharpen it, but what about its inherent qualities? You know that magic enchantment on it? Or that spell it seems to cast every once in a while? Our form of blacksmithing works on those innate properties and spells instead. We don't strengthen the exterior; we strengthen what's inside, and bring the potential of that weapon up even higher. That low-level ice spell your sword casts? Yeah, let's work at it until it casts a stream of frost. It's going to take a while, but anything worth doing is going to take time. Better live with that fact.


-Do One Thing At A Time (Dinotopia) (300CP)
        When you focus yourself on doing a single task, your skill and efficiency doubles. Material requirements are unaffected, but time taken is halved and quality is doubled


-Master Craftsman (Forgotten Realms) (300CP)
        You are exceptionally skilled at crafting things. At your worst, your results are masterwork.


-Mechanic (Ragnarok Online) (300CP)
        While the Mastersmith socketed and improved items, the Mechanic instead focuses on machines namely the mado- gear that they are known for. Their proficiency allows them to improve machines the same way a blacksmith might improve a sword, and Mechanics with extensive experience can slot machines to accept external improvements.


-True Balance (Earth Girls) (300CP)
        Despite how crude the raw materials seem, the finished weapons and tools of your work are perfectly suited for their job. A hammer you make of stone and wood is just as fine a tool as one you could make out of steel, and a stone spear cuts just as deeply as any you could make of carbon fiber and razor- honed alloy.


-Ambrosial Artificer (Macross) (400CP)
        So many moving parts, so many pieces to the puzzle. It's so... needless. The other tech teams are complete morons. That's why you've learned how to figure out the optimization of your complex machines like Veritechs. What parts you don't need, you find a way to do away with. What parts you DO need, you can use the now-extra space to improve and bolster their performance. Some will call you mad. But the only madness that will come from your work is the rage of your enemies and rivals.


-Behold Haxcalibur (Modded Skyrim) (400CP)
        Congrats, you broke the crafting system. Anything and everything you make, build, enchant, or otherwise create is now ten times better than it really ought to be. Make an ordinary dagger that does 12 damage? Now it does 120. Pick up an endgame weapon and enhance it for its supposed max of 200 damage? 2000. Guns that hold more bullets and do more damage, magic staffs that massively amplify your magic, armor that shrugs off OHKO's, potions that let you ignore 110% of fire damage, weapons with ten or twenty enchantments. And if that wasn't enough, you'll learn anything crafting related ten times as fast, just to blow the competition out of the water even more.


-Cult Classic (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        It might not be the most popular game ever, but it still has one of the most loyal fan bases of all time. Every product you make has a chance of developing a cult following, with objectively better games having increased chances. Not all that useful, you say? Well, I forgot to mention that your fans will be incredibly susceptible to influence. Want them to attack a politician on social media? Done. Want them to help fund the next game in your series? Done. This is also a capstone booster, see notes below for details.


-Elemental Mastery (Monster Hunter) (400CP)
        Any elemental properties your weapon carries are significantly amplified by up to 50% depending on the quality of the weapon.


-Emotional Storms (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
        Most forms of precipitation and rain in the Demon City derive from the Yozi called Hegra, the Typhoon of Nightmares. She collects the constant fog of dreams that rises from Creation and condenses them into her clouds, to dispense them to the rest of the Demon City. Sometimes, she lashes the terrain beneath her with cold sweat from victims of night terrors. Sometimes, she sends erotic cloudbursts or blizzards of fancy. Anyone who touches her rain and snow, sleet and hail feels the emotions and perceives the visions of Creation's dreamers. So too, may you now infuse your works with emotion and dreams, that all who drink from your hand, all who look upon your works, all who read you writing, all who hear your voice and more besides are affected by the emotions you choose to infuse. Delirious passions, mad fear, and ever-changing visions are yours to grant to all you wish. Such is the strength of these moods and visions that you could drive mortals mad with them, if you are not careful. Though those of stronger make, like demons, will delight in them and revel in the exquisite experience.


-ENGINEERING ITERATION (Sunrider) (400CP)
        The highly analytical mind of a prototype can always see a way to improve something. Even with existing materials and techniques, there is always a slightly better way for you to manufacture a certain part or lubricate a joint. The improvements you make to your devices are noticeable and potentially endless, but you quickly find yourself at the mercy of diminishing returns. You can expect the first 50% worth of improvements to be reasonably attainable and up to 75% expensive, but beyond that it becomes prohibitively expensive.


-Evolve Each Day (Green Worldz) (400CP)
        Every time your weapons are deployed in the field, you gain data. Data on what worked and what didn't, data you can use to make your weapons better. Even if you don't actually get a report from the user or recover the weapon from the field at all, you will still learn how and why the weapon failed, and how you can improve it to ensure such a thing never happens again. At least, not for the same reasons as last time.


-Green machine (Factorio) (400CP)
        You have a knack for wringing every little bit of efficiency out of a system as possible. Your machines produce less pollution, consume less energy, and work just a little bit faster. On a larger scale, you know how to create a well-organized factory complex that makes efficient use of space, your conveyor system minimizes transport time and is free of bottlenecks, and you easily account for future expansion.


-Inspection and Rework (Generic Factory) (400CP)
        Whenever you are assigned to deal with quality control, you find that most of the rejections are things that can easily be corrected and you never allow a truly defective product past your knowing gaze.


-Lathe of Heaven (Chrono Trigger) (400CP)
        We're always going to need weapons, so the way I see it, you might as well get good at making them. Now? You'll be able to give old man Melchior a run for his money. Swords, guns, armor, even sunglasses - if it's worn or wielded, you can make it a masterpiece. You'll also learn how to make use of any material, bringing out its best qualities and minimizing its weaknesses. You could make bone sharper than steel, gold sturdier than titanium, and take a legendary material nobody's ever seen before, and figure out how to forge it, what to alloy it with, and how to craft that alloy into an impossibly sharp sword or some amazing shades.


-Machine empathy (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (400CP)
        Long exposure to strange energies and abstract thought inevitably leave their mark on a heretek. Usually these changes are debilitating or disfiguring, but you have only benefited from these alterations. A tiny glimmer of psychic power has awakened within you, one that will demand careful use and strict discipline to cultivate safely. As your power develops, machines will come to increasingly favor you, completing desired tasks without needing to be asked, performing faster and more efficiently. Machines in the hands of others will rebel when directed to harm you, guns jamming and sensors refusing to lock on. Many other ways to manipulate the mechanical will be revealed in due time, if you have the strength of will and ingenuity to discover them.


-Mechanical Master (Borderlands) (400CP)
        You are a master armsmith and roboticist. You can build and maintain standard weapons and shields with ease, and if you put some effort into understanding it you could probably make E-Tech your bitch. Further, you can make temporary Digistruct items, though they tend to explode after brief use. If you find the right components, you might even be able to modify good stuff into truly unique weapons; some might call them Legendary. Though for some reason they always look kind of pearly.
        * Has some other stuff but the main point is turning things legendary and them looking good


-Metamor Stair (Medaka Box Abnormal) (400CP)
        Evolution is a wonderful process. It made these humans that are so fun to mess with, didn't it? But sometimes you can't be bothered waiting a few millions years for something to happen and just want it now. Now you can with just a touch, force anything, be it a person or an object, to evolve to a new and better stage up to twice. A monkey could be made to become a man and then into an evolved form of man. A blade could be turned into a chain sword and then into an energy sword.


-Modular Interplay (Satisfactorio Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (400CP)
        Anyone can just shove some snail slime in a tube and shove it into a machine to make it faster, but you can do so much more. You can create modules that can be installed into a machine to make it faster, more energy-efficient, more material-efficient, or some other such improvements. While these benefits do come with trade-offs, years of working with and designing and these modules will let you minimize and, much later, eliminate these downsides. If you don't take this perk, you will not get Factorio-style machine enhancement modules as part of your Satisfactorio Crafting perk.


-One Hit Wonder (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        For whatever reason, you have the ability to make some of the best games possible, using your skills to the fullest of their potential. Whatever game you make, and so long as you put in some effort, it will have a quality to it that makes it enjoyable for just about anyone to play, and if it gets big enough in the media and market it could easily be known as one of the best games of the year, and possibly even of all time. And despite the name, this isn't limited to a one-time thing. As a bonus, this is one of several capstone boosters that will boost any 600cp perks you have purchased to even further heights. Check the notes section below for details.


-Reforge (Terraria - Journey's End) (400CP)
        The Goblin Tinkerer has a special process by which he can enhance various items, improving them in a wide variety of ways, a process which he charges dearly for. Now you know the secrets of that process as well, and can use it to reforge your various items, granting them a wide variety of properties. You can either sacrifice things of material value (I.E. money) or can dump mana into improving the object. The cost in either case depends on how well-made and powerful the item in question is, with better objects costing more to improve. However, one benefit is that your process is refined enough that you can push the reforging to either make the item better or worse, rather than relying on random chance. That said, it is possible for a highly improved object to simply eat the cost and then not change at all, so there is still a risk.


-Secret of Steel (Historys Strongest Disciple Kenichi) (400CP)
        An illustrated guide created by the greatest master of weapons the world has ever known. It keenly details the techniques, methods and setup required to create weapons using traditional Japanese techniques. This text goes beyond that however, and if the directions are followed perfectly it can be used to forge weapons, armor, and tools that are far better than anything that could possibly be made even with the most advanced metallurgic technology. Objects created while still composed of steelwill be significantly stronger than steel and can withstand blows from a Martial Arts Master. Blades made using these techniques will be preternaturally sharp, able to cut through stone, steel and perhaps even more with proper strength and training. Such bladed weapons will almost never lose their edge and require virtually no maintenance. Armor made using these techniques is nearly indestructible and will never rust or corrode. Normal tools will work with such efficiency that even primitive tools can accomplish feats of scale equivalent to highly advanced modern technology. For example, a scythe made with these techniques could harvest an entire field in the same amount of time as a combine harvester or a simple hoe could do the work of a tractor towed plough.
        * Does not only work on steel, it works on other metals too
        * This is a low level cultivation setting, Martial Arts Masters can take on tank shells and missiles and destroy armored buildings in one sword swipe. So the new strength of items made with the help of this perk can be imagined.


-The Anything OS (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) (400CP)
        This is a 'perfect' operating system for any computer. It's compatible with every form of software that exists, runs faster than anything that'll develop in the next hundred years or so, and has no weak points. In general this system is the greatest piece of software that can exist. Updates anytime there is software greater than it to be in the average top ten percentile of the local software. Never downgrades.


-Tim Taylor Technology (Subnautica) (400CP)
        Power systems like nuclear reactors and solar plants produce double their normal output without straining the circuitry. Tools and habitat fixtures may be put into overdrive, increasing effect at the expense of efficiency. While in a vehicle, you may redline the engine, doubling its speed for sixty seconds. Overdrives and redlines drain power very quickly, and will damage components if overused.


-Touch of Improvement (A 'Happy' Harry Potter fanfiction ) (400CP)
        Charity can sometimes be slow to change the world simply because it's impossible to help everyone without burning out, unless you have the means to affect multiple people at once that is. This is not that perk exactly but with it you can target important places and buildings to give them three types of improvement in utilities, atmosphere,and security. Utilities targets the things in that category from electrical wiring and plumbing to the appliances and furniture, Atmosphere focuses on how friendly the place is and whether people find it easier to relax or focus, Security takes care of all the protective stuff from enchantments and animated armor to metal detectors and locks. Three things can be improved in each category after which you'll have to make any changes yourself manually. Perk does not provide improvements in the form of people such as adding human guards for security.


-Triple A Title (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        Even if your game is terrible, it still sells, and it sells well. Regardless of how bad one of your products is, it will still sell incredibly well as soon as it is made available to the market, even if reviews for it have denounced it for the garbage that it is. And should the product actually be good, it will maintain any hype that it had for several weeks longer than would normally be expected, and will continue to sell considerable amounts. This is also a capstone booster, see notes section for details.


-A Gilded Bow (Horizon Zero Dawn V0.9a ) (600CP)
        Be it a Lodge War Bow or a golden gun, the more invested the aesthetics of your weapon, the more efficient, accurate and deadly it becomes. What for others might be only usable as a trophy weapon is for you a weapon twofold as deadly as its undecorated cousins.


-A Mind of its Own (SB Dragon Ball Z) (600CP)
        Obeying orders is one thing, but sometimes a situation may evolve past your orders, and you're no longer there to give new ones. With this, your creations gain a sort of sixth sense that alerts them to what you would like them to do in a given situation. Even when you're not anywhere near them, or dead, they'll still carry things out in a way that you'd most approve of. This also eliminates any issues where your creation will decide to do something for your own good. This isn't the only type of evolution that occurs however. As years pass they will become more efficient, stronger, and overall better. An android you build with the capability to fight a low level Saiyan could easily grow to challenge Vegeta within a few years. One that could fight Frieza may find itself reaching Majin Buu's level of power after half a century or so.


-Chosen of Death (Lord of Light) (600CP)
        Great Yama, Death-god, has seen you clearly and bade you enter the Vasty Hall of Death, to serve as his partner in creation. Not merely revealing his secrets of science -you are his equal in the arts. Your creativity is that which may forge ten unique treasures each day, or mass produce legends. Design of all forms of weapons, armors, vehicles, and utilities comes to you with blinding light and strength of inspiration. With this position comes the virtual guarantee of rebirth in your next life, as a Demigod of the forge.


-Craftsman of the Gods (Viking Saga) (600CP)
        Things you make yourself from base components gain properties far beyond what they should. Belts that increase strength several times over or a spear that never misses are well within your skill, and you will only get better.


-Legendary Master: Construction (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert architect capable of realizing truly magnificent and strange buildings. You know exactly how to balance the weight of any given structure to prevent collapse and can utilize even the weakest materials to support whole mountains. You are uniquely capable of reproducing or near reproducing almost any large-scale structure given appropriate resources. If you know how to produce something you innately understand how to build the facilities needed to manufacture/maintain it.


-Legendary Master: Crafting (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert at the manufacture of goods of a truly staggering variety, whether its rolling joints, creating sci-fi tier ray-guns, or sewing a doll. The speed at which you create any of these implements is vastly increased and becomes shorter every time you successfully complete one. Every time you produce a copy of something you've already made it is slightly improved, a rough 1% increase in overall function. This stacks fully with successive fabrication though you must be personally involved in the process of creation. Roughly one in every 1000 of your creations will be Legendary, doubling all improvements from this perk and bearing a unique 'artwork' based on an event from your Jumps. Decided by myself, if you don't mind.


-Living Antibody (Generic Cubicle) (600CP)
        When you are working on a project, your mere involvement will cause errors, mistakes, bugs, flaws, or other issues with the project to be fixed almost automatically, with the errors correcting themselves and disappearing as you work on the project. Something as simple as tapping refresh over and over could be a viable way of actually fixing a program and any underlying issues it might have, with more dedicated efforts causing the errors to vanish that much quicker.


-Master Craftsman (King Arthur) (600CP)
        Thanks to being taught by faeries, anything you make by hand is a great deal better than anything regular humans can make. Armor is nearly indestructible and lighter than it should be, blades are sharper, blunt weapons have more force behind them, bows and crossbows can shoot farther and are easier to pull back. Even mundane items like baskets work better, though you can't give items mystical powers without being a wizard or something.


-Mastersmith | Expert Smithing (Ragnarok Online) (600CP)
        Mastersmith (200CP)
        The Mastersmith can socket items allowing him to add slots where modifications can be implemented onto items. While intended for cards, these can be used for other modifications which need slots if need be. (but effectiveness may be reduced)
        Expert Smithing (400CP)
        It's not just about creating the sharpest blade anymore. Improved items now have affixes on them based on how many times they've been improved. Each level will be tougher than the next to improve and require more energy/mana/souls, but the Blacksmith's smithing ability now has no cap.


-Material Synthesis Science | Exotic Compatibility (Gundam - After Colony) (600CP)
        Material Synthesis Science (200CP)
        You know a few things about getting your own materials, but you also have a bit of know-how about how the people here get such quality materials. Normally, you know how to forge, quench and mold materials into more high quality specimens, but you have a specialization in Zero-Gravity Material Synthesis as well-in microgravity conditions, you can create much more effective materials thanks to the limitations of gravity being removed.
        Exotic Compatibility (400CP)
        You have a way of working with quirky and strange materials-in your hands and machinery, it assumes the forging and abilities of plain Iron until you begin building with it. You also can integrate exotic materials into your constructions a lot easier, and if you don't know what a material is or what it can do, you're very good at researching applications and properties of said materials. This research could also go into things such as improving production numbers and similar.


-One Bajillion Science Packs (Satisfactorio Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
        You can use the research system from here to research small, incremental, quantitative improvements to one characteristic of a class of equipment, machine, or device, like +5% shooting speed for laser weapons, +2.5% top speed for ground craft, or +2% mining productivity. If something would benefit in the same way from two different types of boosts, only the greatest boost matters. (For example, with +35% handheld weapon shooting speed and +15% bullet shooting speed, the boost is 35%.)
        You may share the benefits with your Companions and Followers. All users of this Perk on the same chain share the same set of boosts that have been researched. This Perk can apply to anything the user designs, builds, or uses, and can be toggled or scaled down by the user. While this might not sound like much, you may research the same boost as many times as you wish. The benefit increases linearly, but the costs increase quadratically; the Nth level requires N2 times the amount of all types of research materials used for that particular boost.
        If you take this, then every delivery (of an orbital probe, 500-meter truss, or quantum-grade accelerator magnet) you make using a Space Elevator or Rocket Silo will grant you the research materials needed for this type of research, with each item delivered granting you enough of these specialized materials for the first level of research. You will need other types of research materials as well, but these are of the kinds you have already unlocked and produced.


-OPTIMIZED (The Culture Minds) (600CP)
        Newer isn't always better, and ancient does not mean something isn't advanced. In high civilizational scales, the musty old tech used by Elder civs cannot necessarily be improved on by those of younger, more vibrant species and in around 40% of cases, the older forms of technology win out over the newfangled stuff. Your stuff is almost always in that 40%.
        Unless something is specifically engineered to counter your own tech or an effect your tech produces, newer technology is likely to have holes that your older tech somehow gets through. Software designed to counter sentient viruses might let an old malware script you invented decades ago through; armor made to turn aside bullets and beam weapons might fail before the simple geometry of your knife blade...and should you slumber for a vast amount of time, the world you wake to will likely have forgotten what you are and what you are capable of, innocent to any of your devices that have been forgotten along with you.


-Reduce, Reuse, Rearm (Dota 2) (600CP)
        Again, and again, people assume science immediately yields results. That there is one final answer to be found, which magically brings about utopia. Many would disagree in what specific meaningless poetic way they prefer science as, but it is easy to see that the more one works the more results they may potentially attain. That's not to say dead ends don't exist, and that one can mindlessly bash their head against a wall until a new weapons design pops out.
        Either way, your methodology has embodied the constant march of science on a philosophical and practical level. You switch yesterday's capacitor for tomorrow's, yesterday's explosives for tomorrow's, every single bit of information gained from field tests and routine maintenance near-instantly analyzed in order to devise a new upgrade, meager as it might be. So it is, that a gun designed and wielded by your hand will change from firing rounds heard long before they strike to punching through a dark sorcerer's inner sanctum and striking them down before the soldiers outside hear it in a year of daily use. Channels give way to water wheels give way to pumps and complex sets of tubes as one realizes the imperfections in a system and creates a better method. While these simple refinements are surprisingly unhelpful in regards to the mystical arts and physical practices, a constant level of technological enhancement is incredibly helpful, even for one who lacks eternity.


-Resistance Ignorance (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (600CP)
        In many ways mages are on top of the world power-wise. After all, someone can only get so good at swinging a sword or hammer before things sort of just stop getting better. Magic isn't limited like that, someone can go from throwing a fireball that engulfs a tree or two, to casting grand spells that can change the world or lay the groundwork for apotheosis. However, there is one primary issue with magic as a whole, and it can be summed up in two words: magic resistance. The power to rip someone's soul out is only good if it works, and it'd be quite unfortunate for you to attempt something of that nature, only to have some meathead barbarian bash your skull in with an axe because of some amulet or innate resistance. Now that's no longer a problem. An absolute resistance to magic is now nothing before you. Your spells and magical items do damage like they weren't even there to begin with, and that's if they had a full immunity. For those unfortunate enough to have less than full immunities, or none at all, they'll see your offensive magic becoming that much more effective against them.
        * Bypass magic resistance with your items


-Rubedo (Lords Of The Night - Zombies) (600CP)
        You can imbue your craft with perpetuity. For gross structure, you can form a half-real substance from Corpus and Gold that, when invested in an object, perfects and transcends that object. Afterwords, you're left with the perfected shadow of the transcended object. Such shadows resist damage much like lesser artifacts, and if they are somehow damaged will restore themselves over time. The shadow is also just better then the original untransended object was. It costs roughly five parts gold for every one part of the object to be transcended. For engines and other systems that need to be fuelled, it starts out costing as if to pay to transcend enough fuel for it to run all day to create a perpetual engine that runs on a common fuel. There is no good benchmark for all the different exotic fuels you might have, but it's safe to say that it grows exponentially more expensive the more exotic the fuel.


-Self-Made Shopkeeper (Recettear) (600CP)
        On the quest to stock your shop with truly unique wares, you've learned a skill to fuse items, on a level that no mere shopkeeper could manage by themselves. Anybody can sell a pineapple or a banana, but only you can sell a pinenana! Ok fine, it's actually not that simple. The Fusion spell taught to you works well on items which have the same inherent properties, in the case of two fruits, or two swords, and so forth. Shopkeepers can rejoice that the value of the final product is the additive sum of both ingredients, but only one item can serve as a base, while the other item is consumed. That pineapple that I used as a base for demonstration... well now it can be peeled like a banana. That's handy, right? For any item that this is applied to, it will retain a single trait from the sacrificed item. It's almost as if you were breeding items. On second thought that probably isn't the best comparison to be making.


-Transhuman Protocols (Generic Cyberpunk) (600CP)
        The things we could do if only every advance wasn't riddled with unseen dangers and hidden consequences. If they're smart they'll listen to you. You can take any technology or procedure that you understand and easily figure out the flaws, pitfalls, drawbacks, and unintended or negative consequences, and as long as you put in the time you'll figure out how to get past them. Whether it's ensuring cybernetic augments don't result in lethal rejection from the body, a gene-modification doesn't make the body eat itself from the inside out with cancer, or that a device to transfer a mind leaves the same person that went in and not just a copy, or just working out the kinks in something you'll find a way. The future is an uphill battle, and there won't be time to make it if you spend it stumbling.


-Minor Blessings | Unnatural Skill/Divine Child (Percy Jackson) (700CP)
        Minor blessings (100CP)
        For one reason or another you've got a god who cares slightly about you and has seen fit to grant you some minor boon within their domains. Choose one god from any pantheon and gain a minor boon from them. The god will care slightly about you but unless you go on to further distinguish yourself it will be more of a minor interest in your affairs than someone they feel the need to help (Effectively think a diminished version of one ability a demigod might have, think minor ones are stuff along the lines of breathing water, lucid dreaming, or appropriate vague extra senses, useful but nothing especially major). This can be taken multiple times.
        Unnatural Skill (200CP)
        Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats which border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopes, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is nigh unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost).
        Divine Child (400CP)
        You are the direct child of a god of your associated pantheon and gain various benefits from this. You gain lesser manifestations of your parent's domains as well as generally being better than an ordinary mortal. You may take most any god as your parent but to take one of the heads of a pantheon as a parent you must take the "Fate finds you interesting" drawback receiving no points for it (you can also do this with a lesser god to get greater powers). Generally this will give you insight into and some control over your divine parent's domains, a son of Poseidon for example can control water and ships, talk to horses, cause minor earthquakes and is empowered within water.


-Master of arms | Ancient Empowerment (Generic Buffy Fanfiction) (1000CP)
        Master of arms (600CP)
        Anything you can wield, can at will, channel your powers. Super strength make a gun's bullets shoot harder, super speed makes it shoot faster, and the bullets can be imbued with your magical energies. In the hands of a slayer, a wooden stake could punch through a robot's metal shell, though this isn't to say weapon quality doesn't matter, as a slayer with a metal axe would still hit considerably harder than one with a wooden stake. Furthermore, weapons become perfectly compatible with you; a holy sword could easily channel demonic power in your hands.
        CAPSTONE BOOSTER: This now greatly enhances your relationship with all items, allowing fragments of your power, skill, and knowledge to remain in the item when you're done with it. The more effort you exert while using the item, the more of your essence is reflected in the item. The item will, in turn, begin boosting the powers it has absorbed whenever you wield them. If you loaned a weapon out to someone, they would find themselves having some of your powers, skills, and knowledge that pertained to that particular weapon. A hammer you used to build a house would make anyone wielding it more proficient in construction, and the pen you used to write down your biology notes would make someone better at biology.
        Ancient Empowerment (400CP)
        CAPSTONE BOOSTER. Just as the very first slayer was empowered with the essence of a demon, you too have been greatly empowered by an ancient essence. This empowerment comes with the obvious physical enhancement we see in slayers, as literally being a slayer is one way this perk may manifest, so it will come with the super strength, the durability, healing slightly quicker, general threat detection instincts, but that's hardly all you get. Your empowerment reflects your origin, drop ins and fighters get the aforementioned super strength, but sorcerers and engineers can trade this for magical power. You also get this whole Chosen One vibe going about you, such that ritual, magic, or mad science project that uses your blood is now twice as effective. Finally, by having this "chosen one" blood, your blood can be substituted for any blood seals meant for specific people. Your blood can open the Seal of Danzalthar even if you're not a vampire, your blood can substitute for lamb's blood in a plagues of Egypt type scenario, your blood can open (and shut) the gateway to Glory's Hell Dimension. This also extends to any item that's restricted by users or race, you can use anything you can get your hands on. You're just really special.


-Daedalus' Student | Titan's Blood (God of War) (1100CP)
        Daedalus Student (600CP)
        It is one thing to work on forging mere sword and shield, but it is another to create truly marvelous wonders... for a mortal. You could make marvelous wings out of bird feathers and beeswax, capable of granting flight to anyone. Or maybe you wish to create an everchanging Labyrinth, that shifts and alters itself depending on how it moves. Regardless, your architect and forging skills have taken a dramatic increase, to the point where the things you create just may have properties and quality they normally shouldn't have, albeit directed towards the purpose of your creations. Through your works, your will be known... but take care that the gods do not take offense with your work.
        Titan's Blood (500CP)
        What a curious thing you are, to have become such a thing. One of your ancestors was a Titan, a primordial being of great power and ability that was responsible with shaping the world as it is. You are not full-blooded, but the effects have been prevalent on you nonetheless; your size may be increased up to fifteen meters in height, with your strength as such that you could throw pieces of buildings one-handed at your enemies. You may also choose one Titan you are a descendent from, gaining aesthetic appearance changes similar to them. But more importantly, you may relax yourself and 'commune' with the world and nature around you; by opening your mind to the world you can learn about it and its secrets quite quickly, along with finding what is the largest threat to the balance of nature. You are of the planet, child. It is your birthright to know these things.
        * *Titan's Blood also grants access to the following boosts for capstones you've purchased:
        * 'Daedalus' Student': Your crafting has undergone a dramatic improvement, to the point where you can make incredible works with the strength of an army within them. You have also gleamed into a new type of crafting, and you can forge energy constructs such as Zeus' Lightning to be used in your wishes.


-Diamond Techniques | Promise of Steel (Summon Night Swordcraft Story) (1100CP)
        Diamond Techniques (500CP)
        Hoo baby, now you're cooking with gas! These are the same techniques used by Craftlord Rondeau, the Diamond Craftlord of Wystern! This means whatever you make is now in addition to being top of the line in performance, also top of the line in looks! If you have this perk as a Craftknight, you're likely to be a Craftlord yourself. If you're an Apprentice, you're likely to be considered the second coming of Craftlord Shintetsu just like Cleru or Pratty! This perk acts as a Capstone Booster for the Drop-In, Apprentice, and Craftknight Origins.
        Promise of Steel (600CP)
        "The promise of a Craftknight is stronger than steel." That's what is said about the dedication of Craftknights, and with this perk it isn't a metaphor. You now have the dedication and willpower to see through any promise sworn, either to yourself or another, although it's only in effect while you're working to make good on a sworn promise.




 --- Domain: Quality: Resources (35) (76 Perks) --- 




-Acquester (Spiral Knights) (100CP)
        In times of crisis and desperation, resources become too precious to use on anything other than necessities. The spiral Order has had to save all their supplies to repair their ship, so you've had to make do on the field. you know how to look for your own resources, remaining self-sufficient in the field through using scavenged items as supplies for anything ranging from simple maintenance to complex construction. Power Cores, Blighted Bones, or even Goo Drops can be used as spare parts or more. With what you've learnt, these days you don't just survive, you thrive. Whether it's machines that power the Constructs or the way that Wolver's fur burns, you've learned to figure out what separates useful resources from useless refuse. The world keeps spinning, knight. Keep up or die.


-Backyard Handywork (Phineas and Ferb) (100CP)
        Who needs a massive machine shop or specially-crafted equipment when you have some plywood and a toolbox? No matter how complex or intricate of a project you might be making, you'll find that you can easily figure out how to substitute commonly available tools and resources for more complex equipment, and still have the final project come out fine. Also comes with a decent understanding of engineering, architecture, and a few other material science fields to help you get started on whatever projects you might want to work on.


-Coconut Tech (Bloons) (100CP)
        You are extremely intelligent, with such a great understanding of technology that you can supplement inferior parts for better parts as needed. The worse the substituted part is, the shorter it will last, but it will function perfectly while the part is inserted. Using vines, wood, and coconuts to replace wires, sheet metal, and batteries is not out of the question. With each building skill gained, you gain the ability to insta-craft a crude version of that building out of thin air.
        * Fort Raiser - Bark Barricade. A fortified wooden wall, twenty feet wide by six feet tall, with wood spikes along the top. Will last for eight hours before breaking down, if not attacked.


-Composition Analysis (Final Fantasy XIV) (100CP)
        "Before you get to work, you need to know what it is you're dealing with!" -that was the first lesson you were taught when you started this discipline. Certainly, your mentor was right. Without knowing what you're working with, you're simply courting with catastrophe. With a bit of help from the Aether tools you have, you can discern the properties of any material you're working with -enough to know if there's an occupational hazard involved with handling them. But with sufficient practice and a discerning eye, you can figure out what any item is made up of.


-Difference Engine (Smash Up) (100CP)
        You can build a computer with anything, at virtually any tech level. Even water channels or a mob with two colored flags apiece.


-Element Analysis (Bomberman 64: The Second Attack) (100CP)
        With a little elbow grease, you can easily identify the elemental composition of ANY material and with the right resources, break it down to its base elements for further use.


-In A [Underwater] Cave, With A Box of [Titanium Wreckage] (Subnautica) (100CP)
        Most people would say that doing science underwater is a bad idea, but not you. Whatever experiments you run in the future will be easily waterproofed, so if your habitat loses integrity you won't lose months of work. You also gain a basic education in this centuries' school system, which is a lot better than it sounds if you consider the tech level.


-Junker (Generic Wretched Hive) (100CP)
        You're good at keeping things running even with shoddy tools and improvised replacement parts. The end result will always work. Not very well or for very long, but it will work. If you can get a hold of decent materials and tools you can do much better, even cobbling together devices almost as good as those that were made or repaired in a proper shop.


-Plowshares from Swords from Plowshares (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (100CP)
        You might have noticed most of the best Squat vehicles and weapons are repurposed mining and industrial equipment. This is no accident, for not only do such things have to be tough, they are intimately familiar to operators and engineers alike. You have a particular genius for weaponizing civilian technology, and finding constructive industrial uses for weapons.


-Rationing (Mad Max) (100CP)
        When you don't have much, it's important to be careful with what you've got. You're very good at saving supplies, ensuring that anything you find of use stays found and that it doesn't get wasted by accident. You'll get every last drop of fuel from a can, and never drop some plastic tubing just because you can't think of a use at the moment.


-Repair Savvy (Outlaw Star) (100CP)
        Your skills in mechanics are top notch. Your weapons, armor, and personal equipment are all easy to repair, and maintenance of all of them takes mere minutes instead of hours.


-Resource Management (Empire from the Ashes) (100CP)
        What can I say? You're an expert at logistics. You know how to extract the maximum possible use out of even the absolute least resources. A ragtag group of counter-mutineers managed to not only survive, but actually attack and make inroads into damaging an almost unimaginably better armed, equipped and numerous group. Just like them, you too can make virtually endless repairs, adapt low level-tech to interface with higher level tech, and in general stretch the usage of those resources far beyond what even the shrewdest economist could ever manage. Mind you, this is for people and tech most of all. While it will work on other resources, even magical, esoteric ones like mana and whatnot, don't expect remotely the same efficiency for them.


-Risk of Disassembly (Mousehunt) (100CP)
        When creating a trap with a hunter in mind, one must consider how often the hunter moves from region to region and also the wide variety of mice capable of utterly demolishing the trap. Since designing a trap to be unbreakable is likely to make it unwieldy, an alternative approach is to engineer it to fail. This philosophy applied to your crafting endeavours allows you to make things which are designed to safely break apart regardless of the circumstance sure, you'll have to reassemble it after it breaks, but the risk of it utterly disintegrating under the force of a dragon mouse's fire is removed.


-Ritualistic (Azeroth) (100CP)
        You are much more skilled at elaborate rituals. You often find that if a ritual calls for the blood of 10 virgins, you can get away with just 5. This only applies to magic such as Enchanting or Inscription, not to anything scientific in nature. So you'll still need those two batteries for your rock'em sock'em robots.


-Scavenger (Ravenwood) (100CP)
        Sometimes, you do not have the luxury of top of the line equipment and need to rely on what scraps you can salvage. You, however, have an advantage, being able to cobble together scavenged bits into functional equipment that work as well as the real deal. This talent will also inherently improve the durability of such improvised equipment to function even when such materials should not feasible hold up under the strains of use.


-Scrap Hound (Dead Space) (100CP)
        You build. Of course, you need parts to build, and, of course, you need materials, usually scrap metal or leftover electronic bits and bobs, to make parts. Whenever you go looking for scrap parts to use as materials, you always find more than you would otherwise, five instead of four, twenty-five instead of twenty, whatever. When you build parts from materials or scrap, you always find you need less materials, on the same order as that bonus, to put those parts together. Really, really useful if you plan to build electronically-based weapons, armor, etc, or extensively modify your own, pre-existing, equipment through similar means.


-A Box of Scraps (Honkai Impact Third) (200CP)
        For rather straightforward inventions you can make them with just about anything if you have the knowledge of how the mechanics of it work. Simple substitutes are easy and you have the ability to fix things easily, able to patch things up with little more than chewing gum as a quick fix that will last a while.


-Astromancy (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (200CP)
        Maybe you were born under a rare cosmological sign, maybe the planets aligned upon your arrival, or maybe it's just luck but your connection to the stars and the movement of the spheres grants you a greater sense of time and the seasons. You know the exact date down to the millisecond if you just think about it, the perfect time to harvest ingredients or plant a garden, and the effect of the cosmos on the world. More than that the stars and their mysteries have an effect on you as well, your magic will be stronger at night some signs and planets affecting certain spells more than others, you'll have endless stamina during the full moon, and possess perfect night vision. You'll also be capable of finding and harvesting truly rare ingredients such as stardust, sunshards, moonbeams, shadow threads, etc. You'll also have a natural understanding of the prophetic significance of the passage of the celestial bodies in the sky, day or night. Those conversations with centaurs will finally make sense to you.


-Built-In Geo-Nav (Dead Space) (200CP)
        It's like you have a rare materials detector built into your head, with how easy you make it seem to find the really good stuff. Whenever you're looking for materials, be it rare metals, gemstones or crystals, or even just treasure in general, you can feel something, "pulling," your new quasi-sense in various directions, and in different ways based on what the material in question is. As a side benefit, this enhances your ability to navigate, allowing you to, in almost all cases, just kind of know the right direction to head in, to the point that your RIG will mark a path towards your hunch.


-Cold Fires (Final Fantasy XIV) (200CP)
        The hotter the fire, the easier the metal is to form -but too hot, and the metal will simply melt away. That's always been a conundrum which you had to solve. The mages however, have a different solution for your problem. By imbuing fire with Aether, you can reach the conditions necessary for forging at far lower temperatures than normal. Similarly, the intensity of any fire spell you cast is significantly increased.


-Duct Tape Master (CATastrophe) (200CP)
        Earless relics aren't the only thing that's shiny. You're a master at jerry-rigging mechanical components into an ungodly abomination of gears and circuits that somehow still works as intended. Fixing broken things is a breeze (though they might break more easily now) and making new teknologee by recycling parts from old ones is within the realm of your skills.


-Eccentric Talk (Medaka Box Abnormal) (200CP)
        It's so not cool to run out of bullets in the middle of a firefight. Dramatic? Sure, at the right time, but it is hella not fun to find yourself in that situation. Seems like you needn't worry from now on as any weapon you have just doesn't run out of ammunition. Whether it uses bullets or energy or something weird like rocks or rubbish, it looks like firing that stuff out doesn't actually get rid of it from within the weapon itself. Emptying the gun wouldn't let you take out as much ammo as you want, it only works when you're actually using it in the weapon.


-Essencetapping (Aion) (200CP)
        You know the basics of magically extracting valuable materials from your surroundings in a way that won't damage the environment or source. In addition; post-jump, you may use this ability to gather resources native to other settings. You have mastered extracting all but the most exotic materials, and as an added bonus; you often find rare materials in your endeavours. Also, your post-jump essencetapping will find the occasional Atreian material gathered alongside native ones.


-Garbage Bin Grants (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
        The sad truth is that artists starve and so do scientists. A certain number of resources will be eventually poured into a project and often enough the Genius in question finds themselves grasping for one last essential component but with little to no money left. You are unusually adept at finding useful components in the most unlikely places. As long as you have a garbage respiratory that can viably hold things that you need for a project, such as computer parts in a junkyard or car parts at an impound, you have a great likelihood of finding what you are looking for, and even finding things that you wouldn't expect on site that will help with future projects.


-House Calls (Stargate Atlantis) (200CP)
        Perform surgery and even medical research without being hindered by the lack of proper operating theatre or the locals' less-than-sophisticated equipment. You still need some sort of equipment, or a space for surgery, but dodgy equipment or a dodgy place to operate won't hamper you.


-Hunt Automation (Mousehunt) (200CP)
        If you're a hunter who relies exclusively on traps, the process of setting up a trap and waiting for a bite can get quite monotonous, even as you venture into unknown regions and get a chance to sightsee. Why not have the trap micromanage itself even more, so you don't have to sit and wait to reset the mechanism? For all of the traps at your disposal, you can arrange for them to automatically clean up and re-arm themselves, this only pulls a small bit of energy or stamina from you each time it activates, which can also serve as indication that your traps have triggered. Even in the event that your traps are destroyed, you can expend a greater portion of energy for them to reform themselves while you're doing something else provided that they aren't erased out of existence entirely anyways.


-None Wasted (Earth Girls) (200CP)
        An ordinary butcher can get every edible scrap from a carcass. An excellent one, like yourself, can make sure every usable scrap is harvested. Even though you cut up an animal for meat, you save the hide in a perfect state for tanning, the tallow for burning or other use, the guts for strings. This also comes with the knowledge to preserve the parts correctly and tan leather the stone-age way.


-Nuts And Bolts (Ben 10 0.1) (200CP)
        Okay, so you're tough and you can snatch a few wallets. But you know what a good start for making some money is? Salvage. You're excellent at finding useful parts and mundane materials on the fly. Need metal? Those old railroad spikes look handy. Need some wires? There's an intact bundle in that old machine over there. As it turns out, this also makes you pretty good at shoving these parts together to make something good...or at least something you can sell. Weirdo stuff like intact alien tech, special parts, or 'exotic' materials need a bit more work to get depending on how rare they are, but the effort's worth it, right?


-Professional Plunderer (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (200CP)
        Monsters are a curious thing, they destroy and threaten people on a daily basis, however, the drops and loot from hunting them can be highly profitable, especially from high-level ones in the hands of a skilled alchemist. Good artifacts need good materials and professional hands. In that sense, you got the first half in the bag already. You have insane luck when it comes to harvesting or looting raw materials, often encountering more than you wanted, of better quality and from time to time even drops far better than average.


-Reclaimer (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Not all parts are interchangeable, but the secret to fitting a square peg in a round hole is just to get a really good lathe to file the corners off with. You are the master of adapting parts to do wildly different jobs for systems they were never designed to interface with, even if you have to build the interface yourself.


-Reclaimer (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (200CP)
        Rare is the heretek with wealth or connections enough to acquire the resources to pursue innovation without raising suspicion. Most must make do with whatever they can scavenge or build for themselves, and fortune seems to often favor them when harvesting useful components from wrecked machines. More often than not, the most delicate and valuable pieces of technology can be pulled intact from wrecks you find or create.


-Scrap Diving (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Whenever searching for salvage, you're incredibly lucky in finding the parts you need.


-Scrounging (Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura) (200CP)
        It's a sad fact that finding the right materials and components for your research and manufacturing can be a difficult task. Collecting the necessary tools to create Molotov Cocktails and Healing Salves might be fairly easy, but for more complex devices it can take days to find the things you need. Lesser inventors might need to keep track of every source of tools, from the General Store to the local junk merchant to areas for finding medicinal herbs... but not you! Your keen sense for finding the materials you need means you'll always have a vague idea of just where to go to buy that Minute Steamworks, Tesla Coil, or Spirit Of Camphor, and you're quite likely to walk into the store right when they're on discount. Amazing!


-Universal Ammunition (Dead Space) (200CP)
        Plasma batteries? Javelin spears? Force energy? What are those? The only thing you ever seem to find, from here on out, as far as ammunition goes, aside from special ammo types, are these little gunmetal black and yellow battery-like ammo cartridges. The exchange rate varies from gun type to gun type, one clip, or magazine, or cartridge, or whatever, at a time, but it's always enough to fill the gun you're using. Just don't think about the logistics of having a single kind of ammunition that just works for every gun possible, pretend like it makes sense in the space future, and we'll all be just fine.


-Automatic Looting | Waste Not, Want Not (Mass Effect Andromeda) (300CP)
        Automatic Looting (100CP)
        A Technician can be called in to fix things in the middle of a fight. But when your focus is on keeping your head on your shoulders, who has time to pick up those supplies you ran past 3 hours ago? You, that's who! You now have two things: First, you have some sort of pocket-universe/bag-of-holding/bigger-on-the-inside backpack/whatever that allows you to carry a large amount of loot. The loot will be unsorted, and while you can carry a lot and not notice, you also cannot immediately use what's in your loot bag. You'll first have to have your mineral wealth in the right place to build something with it, and equipment needs to actually be equipped before it can be used. Second, you gain a sort of aura or field that will automatically put anything (that hasn't been claimed by another being) nearby you into your loot bag. Stumble across a dead Kett, you get all the loot a thorough check would have found you if you'd taken your time. A farmer's vegetable field wouldn't work, unless you are knowingly stealing from the owner. The size of the looting-aura grows with how quickly you can move and what areas you can actually access. And the loot you get is determined by your skills. For example, if you have butchery skills, you can auto-loot meat, bones, and/or skin, while skills with electronics would let you get intact pieces of robots. The size of a single item would go up to and include a shuttle or the Nomad. If you run into something bigger than that, you'd need to have the skills to break it down to fit it.
        Waste Not, Want Not (200CP)
        Sometimes a Technician just doesn't have the resources they need to get the job done. That's when you have to get creative with what you consider a resource. You have the ability to break down objects that you can personally move into their component parts and/or resources, whichever you wish. If you need a bit of Eezo, an Initiative gun should have some. Don't want to murder some harmless Eirochs? Kett gear usually has some Eiroch Fluid Sacs incorporated into it. In addition to breaking down objects, you also have an accompanying pocket dimension for just resources and/or component parts. It doesn't weigh on you, and you can easily carry around enough resources for any job. If you have the Automatic Looting perk, you can choose to have any raw resources you pick up to go straight into your Resources Bag. And any crafting you do can pull straight from your Resources Bag.


-Crimson Weapons (Etrian Odyssey) (300CP)
        When you look at the various giblets you carve off of the monsters of the labyrinth, you find many of their parts are suitable for crafting weapons and armor. In fact, they're usually outright superior to regular materials. With time and effort, you could make just about anything you pry off of a monster into something useful. You could turn a lion's claws into a wicked-sharp sword, or a pair of horns into an excellent bow.


-Makeshift Weaponry (Bartimaeus Sequence) (300CP)
        Did you just duct tape that magic wand together? Never mind, apparently you CAN do that. Using exceedingly mundane tools, you are able to repair and make improvements to weapons that by all rights shouldn't be able to be repaired that way. Why yes, you CAN glue the detonation stick back together and make it work just fine. Oh and don't worry about that shattered elemental sphere, we can just tie it back together with twine!


-More With Less (XCOM) (300CP)
        Through careful construction, you can remove unnecessary components and get maximum efficiency into your products. What this means, is that you can create the same quality item while using less resources. Items with which you have a limited supply, such as alien materials, can be stretched farther.


-No Monsters Were Harmed in the Making of This Product (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (300CP)
        The bodies of monsters are useful resources for all sorts of things (Dragon scales make nifty armor, Slime substances can be used for various potions/elixirs, Demon Realm Boar meat is incredibly healthy and invigorating, etc.), so now that monsters are friendly (sometimes too friendly), it's become easier to obtain these once-rare ingredients. However, this leads to a dilemma: how to extract the items without hurting the innocent Mamono. At the lowest level, this perk helps you sense what parts of a creature's body could be useful/profitable (it won't help you exactly identify their use, but it will at least let you know if they're worth taking a look at). But more than that, the perk enables you to easily extract things from a subject's body without actually harming the individual, even if doing so would normally hurt or even kill the person. The subject will generally heal any scars without trouble afterwards, and any removed parts that are irreplaceable will regenerate. Plus, you gain increased skill at preserving the extracted materials for extended durations until you can find a good use for them or hawk them off to buyers.


-Salvager (Babylon 5) (300CP)
        When the ore runs out and the company tells the miners to leave, that's where you really shine. It's cheaper to leave gear to rot in an abandoned site than it is to get it into orbit, across the galaxy and set up again so there's always something good just waiting for a new owner. With this skill you are an expert at jury rigging tech, taking it apart, stripping out the usable parts and putting them into something else. With time and effort you can puzzle out the workings of most technologies and how to integrate them into your own gear. Every day or industrial equipment might take a few moments, but bleeding edge gear will take years, even decades to understand.


-Scrapper (Fallout 4) (300CP)
        You have the capability to dismantle and repurpose objects for your own creations; even ones that you might not fully understand. So long as it's not hopelessly beyond your understanding, indestructible, or ridiculously big, you're capable of taking most things and reducing them to their base components, salvaging any working parts with only a few days of work at the worst.


-Scrapyard Skills (Swat Kats) (300CP)
        Where others see junk, you see treasure just waiting to be utilized. You can make far more use out of scrap metal and tossed out electronics, repurposing them for many different tasks. That washer machine might have the parts needed to help spin an engine turbine, or that piston tube might be JUST the right size to refashion into a grappling hook launcher... it's all in how you use it and how you repurpose things.


-Waste Not (Monster Hunter) (300CP)
        Use half as many resources as usual with a chance of not needing rare materials at all.


-Arcane Emulation (D&D Eberron) (400CP)
        To enchant is to create the greatest of items. To enchant without magic is pure bullshit, but is doable with certain tricks shared only amongst the most secretive of crafters. Thanks either to learning from them or to discovering these abilities yourself, you can craft magical items without the need for related spellcasting. Further, you know all the little tricks to minimise the resource costs of your items, which whilst minimal by themselves add up to maybe halving the total time and resource expenditure per item.


-Efficiency (Ninjango - Masters of Spinjitzu) (400CP)
        Waste not, want not! Not with this, anyway whether building machines or making quick moves in combat, you'll never unintentionally use more energy, materials, or flourish than you need to.


-High-Tech, Meet Low-Tech (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        Beyond the Yellowstone system, technology is often not quite up to speed. More so, in the Post-Melding time. Colonists isolated by lightyears from their nearest neighbors must be ready to handle any failure of their machines, so reliable, low technology is usually more common than quickmatter and full automation. Yet when it comes to merging the two, you have a fascinating ability to keep high-technology devices running by replacing failing systems with low-tech equivalents. Where a space station might have used superconductor radiator panels to manage temperature, you could find a way to replace them with steam cooling; when your shuttles run out of antimatter, you'll find it easy to replace those drives with a fusion torch or even chemical rockets. At the extreme limits of your ability, you might replace a simple but essential computer with a mechanical calculator, crunching out numbers with cogs, punch cards and levers.


-Honor the Machine Spirit (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes) (400CP)
        Apothecaries tend to the bodies of the dead, Chaplains to their spirits. Techmarines tend to the spirits of the Machine. You are a skilled salvager. For example, while others might see a destroyed tank, you can see a way to salvage usable parts, perhaps restoring another vehicle to fighting trim or finding a way to save unique weapon systems to be re-used another day. This also gives you a strong grounding in the Rites of Reverse Engineering, able to examine unknown technology and figure out basic functionality by comparing it to devices you are already familiar with. You also have a much broader definition of the word 'damaged', able to restore machinery that others would swear was inoperable or destroyed given enough time and as long as you have enough of the original damaged parts to work with.


-Lack of Materials (God of War) (400CP)
        Times are tough in this land. Forces beyond knowing, monsters that roam the lands, and gods who are as petty as they are powerful. With chaos such as this, there are times you may not be able to get everything that you need. But you've learned to make do. You can get the most out of your materials, using two bars of metal where you might need four, or three hides when you need six. Of course, if you DO have all the materials required you can use them to make your creations more effective in quality and capability as well. So maybe it doesn't hurt to put the extra mile in.


-Making Do With Less (Freefall) (400CP)
        Is your last name Ambrose or perhaps MacGyver? Any time you use materials, they always seem to just work better than they should. Utterly useless scraps become usable if makeshift repairs and construction. Decent stuff is spun into great, great to esoteric, esoteric to outright absurd results. If used on the same thing twice, it won't enhance previously affected pieces further, though newly added bits would be. So long as you already had the skills, you could get a ship space worthy using only the random stuff that a none too knowledgeable thief happened to scrounge together. If you already had a perk that improved the effective quality/usefulness of materials, this would be added on top of that.


-Mauler (Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars) (400CP)
        You have the skills of a junkyard hound, able to make even the most heavily damaged tech work again. Even machines too battle-damaged for recovery 20 years ago can be effective under your wrench. Repurposing tech and equipment is your forte; you can turn a pneumatic screwdriver into a reasonable cannon, and heaven help your enemies if you get anywhere near mining equipment, as a power-armored mutant is quickly appearing in their future. There was even one time where you made a toaster into a reasonable facsimile of a flamethrower.....


-Monster Harvesting (Warhammer Fantasy - Amazons) (400CP)
        Without the power of industry or technology that civilisations like the empire have access to, the Amazons have learnt to be resourceful in other ways. They and now you have become masters of taking the bodies of fallen foes and turning them into weapons, tools and armour. Not only are these removed parts of enemies just as effective as when the enemy was alive, they even retain any special powers or magical qualities they had at the time, even if the being would normally need to be alive to supply those powers. Poisonous fangs will continue to bleed venom even after being torn from a giant snake's mouth and turned into a sword, whilst a monster that naturally produced magical wards would continue to do so even when it's hide had been stripped and turned to armour. Along with this skill for harvesting comes notable talent for creating weapons, armour and tools.


-Resource Efficiency (Mass Effect Andromeda) (400CP)
        It's nice being efficient. It lets you make more with less, stretching out vital supplies even further. With this perk, any time you are crafting something, you can make it for half the materials. Just don't ask how you got a full cake from half the amount of ingredients. In addition, anytime you break down an item, you get the full amount of resources that went into it. So, breaking down a gun you made for 50% resources would give you those 50% resources, compared to a gun made by someone else who used the full amount in the construction, and thus giving you the total amount.


-Scavenge (Hellgate London) (400CP)
        You can find usable food and materials anywhere you look, even if you search a empty gas station you are bound to find at least a couple boxes of whatever ammunition you use and some food. When used on equipment or electronics you always find whatever parts would be useful to you.


-Scavenger (Megaman Zero) (400CP)
        You have a knack for integrating junk into your systems or gear and for using them to make field repairs. After all self-repair systems only go so far. You're good at finding compatible parts and at jury-rigging them for the above purposes. That buster could replace the rifle in your arm. While that torso could be scavenged from for repair your own though these parts will not work fully if faulty, and you can't integrate parts too different from or incompatible with whatever you're integrating It into. This allows for free upgrades and repairs, as well as self-sufficiency. Perfect for long solo assignments or just survival. Waste not, Want not.


-Scavenger (Squirrel and Hedgehog) (400CP)
        Thanks to those filthy communists trying to take everything (hypocrisy, anyone?), you've had to learn to make do on things. You can get more 'bang for your buck' on materials and fuels, making machines last longer than they normally should. Furthermore, with crafting and building you know JUST how to use them to reduce your resource requirements. How's THAT for 'not needing unnecessarily' you goobers?!


-Scrap Warrior (Generic Wretched Hive) (400CP)
        One man's trash is another man's armoury. Rocks, shivs, Molotov cocktails, Armor made of scrap. Whenever junk is all you've got it can somehow put up a good show against things far more sophisticated. Shivs find chinks in mil-spec gear. Rocks crack armored windows, while crowbars pry open security doors. It's not an equal footing, but it'll close the gap and turn a hopeless fight into something a lot less one-sided.


-Ship's Engineer (Smash Up) (400CP)
        It takes a lot of know-how to keep a spaceship running, especially with all the things they get put through. Not only are you an expert in the technology of the future, you've learned how to be incredibly resourceful in improvising technology. From using lasers to heat rocks or forge metals, to building a laser with the contents of a prison cell, if an Engineer doesn't have the tools they need, well they'll make the tools themselves!


-Shipping the Product (F.E.A.R.) (400CP)
        Prototypes are one thing, but what about actually getting the damn thing distributed? An item or weapon doesn't help anyone if it's the only one of its kind. You will find your ability to create has increased dramatically in efficiency, letting you use the materials for three of the same items to actually make five while streamlining production lines rather quickly. As a bonus, logistics have increased enough where your shipped supplies are harder to intercept, keeping any allies you have fresh with resources!


-Ultra-High Settings (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        While many may wish they had the beastly computers needed to run games on max settings, many don't. But why should we limit the beauty of your art for such a mundane reason? Your art and animations are such that no matter how hi-res the models or complex the animation it will have a minimal, if any, impact on how well your game runs. This also applies to other items and products you help create, meaning even the shittiest of computers or consoles can run your game at the highest resolution without suffering too much, while products like swords can have designs might seem to hinder a user's ability to swing it when in fact it's just as usable as a normal one.


-Unfed Forge (Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse) (400CP)
        The biggest problem with techniques or artifacts is that eventually, if you don't rise in power, status, or connections, you won't be able to procure the necessary materials needed to also bring your power up to par with others at your level. So I'd say it's a good thing that you have the ability to use the same materials at lower levels to create things at your level of power. If you felt like it you could use Steel to make a Golem capable of killing Celestial Immortals while you were a World God. With materials meant for actual immortals, even baseline Celestial Immortals, you would be able to create artifacts capable of comparing to Universe treasures while weaker than Hegemons assuming you have such a mastery of forging.


-Extraction Efficiency | Harmless Extraction | Rapid Growth (Final Fantasy XIV) (500CP)
        Extraction Efficiency (100CP)
        Judging from the state of Eorzea, the Carpenters and other tradesmen here have long since improved the efficiency of their resource collecting processes. From the record books, while the presence of Aether has helped a great deal, the harvesting practices put into place played a large part as to why the natural landscape is still the way it is today. Adopting those same practices, you've improved on the harvesting efficiency for all manners of things, not just restricted to trees -but other plant life as well. So at least the plant doesn't simply die off after one round.
        Harmless Extraction (200CP)
        With hempen yarn and animal skins in shorter supply since the catastrophe, you and other craftsmen have had to adapt your practices in order to keep the orders met. Practices to minimize the amount of animals killed, to make the most out of that which you have on hand are all crucial nowadays as resources grow scarcer. While the animals still aren't too comfortable with it, with this magic you can weave together a copy of their skin or wool, while only taking a small portion of what they have. It doesn't really feel right, but at least the animal is still alive! It'll take time, but what you've taken will slowly grow back.
        Rapid Growth (200CP)
        You can't afford to wait years for a forest to regrow! By the time that forest grows to a state where it's ready for harvest, you won't even need the lumber to build your house anymore! No, in order to make it in time for harvest this season, you're going to need to draw on some more potent forces.It might be a little bit dangerous to use Aether in such a fashion, but by imbuing the saplings with concentrated Aether, you've successfully sped up the growth rate of the trees -to a point where you can harvest them again. Well, unfortunately, the trees did grow a bit bigger than normal, but you expect that's just a normal side effect from using concentrated Aether to grow things.


-2x4 tech genius (Kids Next Door) (600CP)
        You're able to put together incredible creations from simple household objects. A piece of wood, a battery, a glass bottle, and some duct tape, you can turn it into a working laser rifle. Everything that you make will be very fragile, and more complex creations will require more complex components.


-Hunter Package Tier Two: Fragment of the Dream (Generic Island Castaway) (600CP)
        You are exceptionally skilled at harvesting your kills, as well as preserving them for as long as possible with minimal resources, and you can make use of the materials within an animal's body with great ease, forming bone tools and leather objects in less time then it should take to make them.
        Fragment of the dream tier two would allow you to harvest a beast with nary but a touch and ensure that your animal products never spoil.


-Lost Art (Generic Video Game Developer) (600CP)
        You are now an expert of the lost art, the art of code efficiency. Any code and software you make will now be far more efficient, using up far less resources for the same results and running significantly faster than most standard code. Your game would normally be 16GB and requires 8GB of RAM? Now it uses half that, at least. Game causing lag and crashing because too much is going on? Not anymore. Whatever you code, it'll run fast, and it'll run well.


-Mana Substitution (Generic Builder) (600CP)
        Lacking materials needed for your building? Use magic to permanently create them from nothing if you have blueprints for them (rare, powerful or combined materials take more magic).


-Power Of The Pixel (Starbound) (600CP)
        The pixel is both a form of currency, and a building block for making almost anything. This marvelous technology is the secret behind most manufacturing in the galaxy, and now, you possess this power as an innate ability. You can take any item that you own and break it down into pixels (with minimal lossage), based on its substance, power, and value. You can also take pixels and shape them into any item that you know the structure of, at a pixel cost equal to said items substance, power, and value. This power can extend to other forms of currency as well, though it does require actually physical currency to work. Please note, this power operates off of the actual value of the object, not any fiat value. You will get the same small amount of pixels for an ordinary pebble, even if you manage to get someone to sell it for thousands of dollars.


-Practical Applications (Family Matters) (600CP)
        You have a gift, not for a specific skill, but for applying your skills. Even in bad conditions, with limited resources, you can still get the job done. Whether it is turning ketchup and water into spaghetti sauce, or building technological marvels in your basement from a pile of odd parts, you can make things work, even in circumstances that are considerably less than optimal. You are also extremely innovative and creative with your skills, easily finding inspiration and motivation for your projects.


-REPAIR, REUSE, RECYCLE (PREY) (600CP)
        Neuromods aren't the only revolutionary technology developed on Talos I. The ability to break down components to their constituent materials and dividing them into 4 categories of materials which can be used by a fabricator to make almost anything. These are divided into Synthetic, Mineral, Organic and Exotic. You know all the ins and outs of this technology, able to make it more precise in dividing up material up to the elemental level or divide new materials at the cost of a little more energy. Scaled up you could use these devices to quickly refine mined material strip mined from a planet and use them to mass produce buildings and vehicles. The energy required to make the item is directly proportional to their complexity and size.


-Savvy Scavenger (SimAnt) (600CP)
        Good to the last drop! When you discover a resource, you become aware of exactly how much is available and how much is left to collect. Never leave a single grain, a single drop or a single coin behind ever again.


-Scavenger (Generic Space Opera) (600CP)
        You have an excellent intuition when it comes to finding and salvaging still functional technology. You can see at a glance if a device is still functional and have a general intuition on how to use it and what the effects would be. You also have the uncanny ability to pick out still functional components of unknown tech and can kludge together temporary fixes of technology vastly beyond your understanding, though those will break down and make said technology unrecoverable after a while.


-The Way of the Cube (Unmodded Minecraft) (600CP)
        Whether you were born to the cube or merely adopted it, you have internalized some of the principles of this world and made them your own. When you harvest something, you can choose to have it fall apart into whatever shapes and portions you desire. Pluck a plant from your garden or slaughter an animal from your stables, and they will be instantly and perfectly divided up among edible portions,usable materials and all other categories without the slightest waste. Things harvested with this perk are also just better, blemishes, damage and imperfections corrected during the process. This perk can't be used as a form of attack, so no punching the bones out of someone that bothers you.


-You Built it Out of What? (DC - Blackest Night) (600CP)
        Would you believe the Cosmic Divining Rod, the source of this oncoming disaster, was built out of a mishmash of parts found in a hardware store in some corner on Earth? Whether from your own mastery of engineering or similar mad inspiration, you have a knack for constructing advanced devices out of nothing but common Earth parts and other easy-to-obtain materials. Spaceships made of salvaged parts? Sure. A rod capable of contacting a particular Entity and manipulating emotions? Why not? You can also apply this to other science or engineering you're capable of, substituting rare materials with common parts, and working with as much durability and effectiveness as the real thing.


-Gatherer Package Tier One | Two | Three (Generic Island Castaway) (700CP)
        Gatherer Package Tier One (100CP)
        You are an exceptional gatherer and have a knowledge base geared toward this; you can easily locate edible or medicinal plants and animal byproducts and tell at a glance whether a plant or animal byproduct has useful characteristics as well if it is at the bestpoint of its cycle for use or consumption.
        Gatherer Package Tier Two (200CP)
        You can gather plant-based materials or animal byproducts somewhat out of their growing season as well as prevent their spoilage for longer than it should be possible.
        Gatherers Package Tier Three (400CP)
        When you gather plant-based materials or animal byproducts you collect more than are physically present, and when you consume them they are more effective than they should be.


-Research and Deploy (Terraria - Journey's End) (800CP)
        The secrets of research and duplication are now at your fingertips, though there are a few changes compared to the version from the game. The basic process is still the same. You can 'destructively research' a given item in your inventory or that you can and are holding entirely in your hands, and once you have researched enough of them, you will be able to instantly duplicate said item. However, you aren't able to simply duplicate it for free. Instead, you can sacrifice additional items to build up a reservoir of 'material' that can then be used to create duplicates. Rarer items provide more material, with the amount needed to research a given item being a general baseline. So, if it took 100 items to research one item, and only 1 item to research another, then you would have to sacrifice 100 more of the first item to make one duplicate of the second. A second change is that the number of items that must be researched has been increased. Items that normally might have only taken 1 item to research now need 3 or more, and an item that might have normally taken 10 could take 40 or 50. CP-Backed items can be researched, but their duplicates won't have their CP-backed powers, only the default powers of whatever type of item they are. You can substitute raw mana for 'material', allowing you to create items without having to sacrifice other items first, as long as you have a sufficient amount of mana.


-Reusable Resources | Artificial Alloys (Anno 2070) (800CP)
        Reusable Resources (200CP)
        Recycling requires effort. There is always a loss - in terms of energy, in terms of time, in terms of effort, in terms of materials. Your faction's knowledge of materials science has minimized this loss to the utmost; When destroying buildings, recovering crashed vehicles, or decommissioning equipment, you always recover the same amount of material put into its construction, ripe for being re-applied to other tasks.
        Artificial Alloys (600CP)
        Naturally occurring substances can offer a good start point for the development of new and innovative machinery and technology. However, oftentimes these natural resources have limitations - whether it be rarity, difficulty of acquisition, and so on. In such cases, science steps to the fore, fashioning new materials unseen by nature to do that which mother nature started. This ability allows, with enough time and research invested, to create substances that mimic those found in nature, albeit manufactured artificially. While these new artificial substances do not surpass the original, it can for all purposes be substituted by it with no drawbacks. However, the material must still be manufactured - but, once the process is known, other factions, civilizations, and individuals, by following the process, can also create the artificial material. This ability works post-jump, even for materials that do not naturally occur in the new universe.


-Panzerkampf | Firestorm (Sabaton) (900CP)
        Panzerkampf (300CP)
        When it comes to building war machines, yours are top-notch! A gun made by your own hand will never jam, and a tank built by you will never bog down in mud or take damage from an IED. If they want to destroy what you've built, they'd best bring their A-game.
        Firestorm (600CP)
        When someone absolutely, positively needs artillery good enough to reduce the greatest castle to rubble, they come to you and accept no substitutes. You can throw a cannon together from scraps and it will still outperform the best mortars of the age. Moreover, in other worlds, if you can understand the weapon, you can produce something 1.1 times as strong with the items you would find in a rubbish heap, provided they're of equal size to the device they're replicating.




 --- Domain: Quality: Safety (36) (29 Perks) --- 




-Cry Havoc (World of Darkness - Genius The Transgression) (100CP)
        Mortals cause wondrous technology to go haywire, endangering lives and property. Geniuses call this unique ability of mortals to ruin their creations "Havoc." A wonder touched, picked up, or interacted with by a mere mortal (a being with no supernatural powers) roils with uncertainty and prolonged contact can break down even the most powerful Wonders. In addition this worsens as a mere mortal interacts with the Wonder, for to them the device makes no sense and pointing out the patches that Mania maintains is a good way to unweave them. You can now apply this inscrutability and inability to use technology beyond the kin of mere mortals to all of your technology at will, even when not in contact with the technology or if you only recently gained this power but crafted the device earlier in your carrier. This only applies if the technology would usually be inscrutable to the person in question, those who can understand the tech won't count for Havoc called in this way.


-Divine Rights Management (Unsong) (100CP)
        Why would you ever teach a man to fish, when you could make him come begging to you for every dinner?
        You have a powerful ability to build fine-tuned break-down and failure conditions into just about anything you create, weaving them inextricably into your designs; your creations can be hobbled so irrevocably that they cannot be made whole without also negating the principles that make them function. Only a genius far greater from your own could free what you have limited.


-DNA Lock On (Lilo and Stitch) (100CP)
        You're tired of pesky law enforcement personnel sneaking into your lab. To combat this you have created DNA lock on technology, allowing your machines to target specific creatures, and only them. Of course, this will require collecting their DNA first. You have put this to good use with inventions like your door that only opens for you, and the auto-turret that will refuse to fire if you're standing in the way.


-Guarding the Ark (Lords of the Night - Vampire) (100CP)
        A common important duty for many angels is guarding holy sites and items, for such things can be dangerous to the faithful, and targets of the iniquitous. Perhaps you held such duties in the past? How can you know. This trick hints at such a history You have freed a splinter of your true essence from your incarnate form and may invest it in an object you currently control - you don't need to be the owner, but it can't currently be contested - you could use it on a stolen sword, but not one someone is trying to wrestle out of your hands. Once invested, it will stay so unless the object is exorcised, or you call back your splinter.
        While invested, you count as possessing the object, and as acting as a Watcher, being able to see and sense what goes on around it. You may also start acting as an Controller, Corrupter, and Enhancer when and as you wish. Basically, you can sense what goes on around your object, you may animate moving parts (make a crossbow load itself, make a wagon roll), may curse those who use your object in a way you don't want, and may make it act like a magical item whose strength depends on your strength. These roles are laid out in The Book of Vile Darkness. This perk may be bought more then once. Each time it's bought, you rip free another splinter to invest. Only the first purchase is free from The Lost, but they may buy more at discount.


-Hands Off! (Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops) (100CP)
        When one is at the forefront of technological development, one sometimes has to watch out for espionage. Why bother developing a revolutionary new weapon system when a Ghost with sticky fingers walks in and takes it? You are able to design, and seamlessly implement security protocols into any technology or equipment you have access to that would limit use to only authorized personnel. You don't even have to go to the extreme of half-breaking it either, that's for neanderthals and inferior scientists.


-My Creations, My Children (Heaven's Lost Property) (100CP)
        The Angelroids and other constructs you make are not mere drones or robots - they are, each and every one, your own child. Whether or not you consider that true or care for them at all, your creations with any degree of intelligence or sentience will look to you as a mentor or parental figure, or just a dear friend when you first activate them. Regardless of its nature, they will enter this world with a degree of loyalty towards you, their creator. You know how to maintain this through care or the right mix of discipline and caretaking. This, incidentally, makes you pretty good at actual parenting as well.


-Ruinous Font (Mistborn) (100CP)
        Hemalurgy is a dangerous and dark art, with a natural connection to the god of Destruction, Ruin. Through this connection, Ruin can manipulate the beneficiaries of Hemalurgy towards his own destructive ends. With this perk, you gain the tiniest sliver of Ruin's power just enough to fuel your own Hemalurgy without Ruin's help. Hemalurgic spikes you create have no connection to Ruin, and their users cannot be controlled by him or by emotional Allomancy. You can also make Hemalurgic spikes outside of this Jump. This does not confer any knowledge or ability with Hemalurgy you'll either have to take another perk, or find someone who can teach you. Unfortunately, the only people who can teach you are more likely to kill you instead.


-Black Boxing (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (200CP)
        While certain red-robed rats of Mars always trying to get their grubby mechadendrites on your stuff is annoying, messing with them is endlessly entertaining. You can easily tweak your work to be nearly impossible for others to duplicate. If you're feeling particularly spiteful, you can build in some cross-connections so anyone trying will blow themselves up.


-Father (Blade Runner 2049) (200CP)
        Your children are very precious but not irreplaceable. It's something they remember well when they look at you and see a God. Anything you have created, from natural means or artificially, sees you as a God if you wish it. It can be as a terrifying, wrathful and strict God or as a benevolent, loving and protective God if you desire but they will find your superiority and position to be undeniable. This is not an unbreakable belief but it is strongly held, with enough proof to the otherwise your creations may be convinced that you are not as deserving of such terrified obedience or worshipful devotion. But proving that you are worthy shouldn't be too hard.


-Fumble Spotter (Generic Cubicle) (200CP)
        You excel at finding odd ways in which your products might be used or misused that could lead them to fail, and in devising ways to fix them before they ever become issues. You are also adept at making the proper usage for your products obvious in their design.


-Jumper Technology Activation (Stargate Atlantis) (200CP)
        This isn't so much an item as an upgrade for any item that you've bought with CP or personally made; its user interface will now only work for you and those (if any) you specify. You can change the lock on an affected device just by giving it new orders, but for any given individual this access is all or nothing. The upgrade will also prevent the interface from being bypassed unless it is physically removed, replaced or destroyed.
        * 200CP is for a la carte


-Precision Tools (MtG - New Phyrexia) (200CP)
        The exarchs, elite of the Core Augurs creations, managed to create a thought field specifically attuned to the Mirran resistances minds, disabling their will. While you might not be as versed in the neuroscience involved(yet), you have found a way to attune your creations to a certain group of targets' ' ensuring they will not damage your own allies. This also lets you make your own creations useless against you, ensuring they wont be used to fight you not for long, anyways.


-Tenebrium Basics (Divinity - Original Sin) (200CP)
        Tenebrium is an odd mineral. It grows like a crystal, but can be melted and forged like iron. It is easily enchanted, but highly resistant to other kinds of magic. In addition, it is highly dangerous and inflicts a disease known simply as Rot upon all those who handle it in any form. Worst of all, Rot cannot be cured by simple magical spells, requiring rare and powerful artifacts to cleanse the infected. Most cannot afford such things and slowly wither over the months following handling a single chunk of crystal. But with this perk, you have come to understand how to safely handle Tenebrium without infecting yourself.


-Voice Activation & Palm Locks | Lethal Mode (Dredd) (200CP)
        Voice Activation & Palm Locks (100CP)
        Applies voice activation and palm lock features to any or all items of technology you own, installing it on existing items and automatically installing on new items as desired. In default mode, the DNA locks simply cause the item to not function for unauthorised users can't have someone blowing up your stuff just for trying to take it for a test drive, right? Voice activated items still can't do anything they don't already do. You could tell an M16 safety off, but telling it to use hotshot when it doesn't have the ability to change ammo types won't work, for example. This does not apply to purely magical items.
        Lethal Mode (100CP)
        Even more of a deterrent, this purchase allows you to set a self destruct mode when an ID check is failed. The object will detonate with force in proportion to its size; something carryable in one hand would blow off a person's arm, whereas a car would probably explode with enough force to kill a crowd surrounding it.


-Fantasian (Sorcerer's Apprentice) (300CP)
        Unlike a certain mouse, you maintain impeccable control over any animated objects you create. While it's not like they're truly incapable of overdoing tasks you set, they'll definitely check in with you before doing anything drastic. Constructs with animal intelligence will also quickly and correctly interpret any hand signals you attempt to send, no matter how clumsy. This has some reverse application to non magical applications, like machinery.


-Goo-ery (Eureka-Warehouse 13-alphas) (300CP)
        This large, bulky, steam powered system is used to produce Neutraliser, a viscous purple goo that is used to render Artefacts inert - at least temporarily. Hooked into the Warehouse system, it supplies a steady stream of Neutraliser throughout the building as part of an automated and manual controlled emergency application system, with spray hoses available in each section. Integrates with your warehouse, located in the basement, requires water and electricity supply. Warning: don't eat the goo, you'll... see things. Topical application may cause uncontrollable dizziness and laughter.


-Qu-it It (Irredeemable/Incorruptible) (300CP)
        Your understanding of the technology that you have created or understood to the point where you can consider it 'yours' is so great that you find it almost trivial to come up with methods to use that understanding to deny the benefits of that technology to others who have either appropriated it or developed in parallel. Your understanding of your own created teleportation technology may be so great you can destroy an entire galaxy spanning network of teleporters based on your tech all with the push of a button. However you cannot do this for technology in the hands of those who were the source of the technology, no matter how well you understand it or feel possessive of it, not by the means of this perk at any rate.


-Shaping Gloves (Geneforge) (300CP)
        This pair of carefully crafted gloves allows one to work with powerful or specially modified essence without the typical risks of horrible mutilation, mutation, and death. Usually such gloves are crafted for a specific purpose, these aren't, they seem to work with anything, even Geneforges.


-Deep-Layer Protocols (Crysis) (400CP)
        Technology in your possession is unique in the manner that it is incapable of deviation from your stated goals. Normally, nanomachines detached from the collective whole would run the risk of having their original goals corrupted or subverted without the greater collective to issue orders, but technology held by you can be proofed so such errors are self-correcting. The only way to remove your tech from play is to destroy or disable it. Hacking or other 'tricks' short of a full rewrite by someone who knows what they're doing will not work.


-Fetishist (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (400CP)
        When using Gifts or other kinds of magic to Bind a spirit or creature either in place or into a receptacle, it is far harder for the target to resist. Once bound, it is impossible for them to escape without outside help.


-Laz'r'us Nannies (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (400CP)
        A set of nanites that, when implanted in an individual, will slow their aging to effectively nothing and back up their mind within their skin and other organs, and which can work to regenerate them and revive them, allowing an individual to revive from anything outside of majority body disintegration. And if the nanites are linked to a strong enough computer system, they can upload a copy of the user's mind periodically, which can then be loaded into a cloned body. Comes with a device for creating more, and implanted nannies will adapt to new biologies automatically.


-Secrecy is the Key to Diabolical Success (Donkey Kong Country) (400CP)
        It is critical that top-secret projects remain top secret, even from the people working on it. You are able to ensure that everyone carrying out a secret plan or project you have devised remain completely ignorant of what they are doing/making, without hindering their ability to carry out the plan. For instance, you could have each individual soldier make a single part in his spare time and have your general assemble them together in pitch darkness without peeking, and the secret superweapon will be constructed just as according to plan. That said, it won't work if you need to tell people what the plan is, and sometimes it's a good idea to let your allies know what's up before they reach (wrong) conclusions of their own.


-That's Just Asking For Trouble (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        When you make advanced technology far beyond what the locals are used to, it tends to make waves. Maybe your little DNA database is actually one of the greatest weapons ever created or an attempt to prove you can harness the fundamental forces of the universe ends up destroying a planet. The good news is you're not stupid it's the Genius tree, not the Drooling Idiot tree! You have excellent insight into the moral implications and long-term effects of your inventions if they were used by others or made commonly available, especially when it would be a purely bad idea. Also, just to make sure nobody steals or misuses it, any sort of failsafe you make to keep it from being abused is unable to be hacked or bypassed...if you made a device that works only for a certain person, no amount of hacking or DNA swapping will make someone else pass off as that person. If you need two keys to unlock a certain feature, you bet only those two keys will work. This goes both ways all your devices will come with a backdoor for you to take back control if someone does misuse it, and it will always succeed. Enjoy the look on the face of a wannabe thief when the superweapon they stole from you just shuts down in their hand.


-Cincotrix (Ben 10) (500CP)
        The Mark 5 Nanoshift Enabled Exo-Armor is a powerful Techadon weapon in the shape of a wristband. When activated it becomes a nearly indestructible suit of armor armed to the teeth with a vast arsenal of ranged weaponry. It can also grow a thruster back to allow flight, wheels for high-speed acceleration on land, and a face mask to allow you to survive in oxygen-less environments.


-Smart Immunity (Limitless) (500CP)
        You've had one hit of NZT in the past week, and it seems like you'll never come down. Well, you actually won't, not if you don't want to, that is. You may choose for up to 10 drugs, magical spells, buffs, or similar time-limited boosts that are affecting you to last indefinitely without any of their unwanted side effects. Additionally, you may choose to end any effect (not just the ones maintained by this perk) whenever you want, either through conscious choice or automatically (it is called Smart Immunity for a reason) if you somehow can't but would have if you could. If you already have 10 effects being maintained by this and want to add another, you'll have to allow one of the ones you're maintaining to lapse. You may also extend the duration of any temporary effect by a factor of ten, based on its full duration when applied, but these effects keep their side effects. When you drop an effect from its slot it will continue with any of its original duration it has left. Additionally you may reapply any effect that you have lost if the time since you lost it isn't greater than twice (after adding the potential 10* extension) the duration it offers. Capstone Booster


-A Creator's Love (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (600CP)
        They underestimate the love you put into what you create. The pride of a Necrotect, a true Necrotect, is not just in his own skill but also in the wellbeing of his own creations. For you to awaken and see that the tomb that you built and were buried in still stands, unbroken despite the many centuries of abuse it has suffered, how could you possibly not feel the love of a parent for how long your creations stood tall. For some Necrotects, their creations begin to respond in kind, moving to their will to serve their creator-parents. You may command and control any such construct you have designed and crafted or overseen the construction of as the head of the team. The stone of your tomb bows to your will, blocks shuffling and rolling about to create new configurations. Swords that you craft sharpen or lose their edge at your command or even turn upon their wielders. In your presence, your constructions will even repair themselves from damage, healing as if they were truly alive.


-Corruption of Good! (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (600CP)
        Who says corruption has to be a bad thing? If used in the correct way even the powers of darkness can be powerful weapons in the arsenal of the light. Through prayer and ritual you can turn even the darkest of artifacts to the side of good, channeling the lights power instead of the accursed darkness, as an outgrowth of this you can also "corrupt" or otherwise turn beings of evil into being good and following the path of the light given time and effort even the darkest of creatures can be made to see the light.


-GitD Virus 2.0 (Freefall) (600CP)
        With this you have a selective killer. Before unleashing the program somewhere that it can access the offending AIs, you may designate parameters as to which to ignore, harmlessly disable, selectively damage, and which to utterly destroy. This item's effects start out as strong as the canonic virus, but scale up the greater your abilities, hardware used, knowledge of software, and knowledge of target.


-Three Laws of Robotics (SB Dragonball Z) (600CP)
        Isn't it annoying when those teenagers you kidnapped and subjected to brutal experiments against their will decide to kill you when free? Well no more, because everything you create, birth, or modify is simply incapable of betraying or harming you. While this only applies to creations which can think, you'll never have to worry about them working against your orders, in both wording and spirit. You may choose whether or not this applies to whatever creation you make.




 --- Domain: Quality: Size (37) (25 Perks) --- 




-Engineered to Scale (Mousehunt) (200CP)
        To date, the largest mouse that's been observed weighs in at a staggering 2400 lbs. To contrast this, in the same environment exists a mouse that barely weighs an ounce. Clearly a trap that works on the former would be ridiculously inefficient for the latter, but hunters will typically demand a single trap type, so they don't have to get used to different traps operating with different mechanics. You can address this problem during the production cycle by manipulating the size of your creation: making it twice as large or half as large, whichever is most appropriate.
        Creations made this way do not require extra resources or additional tuning to function, and they'll function just as well with the size taken into consideration.


-Loaded Up (Generic Cyberpunk) (200CP)
        It's not enough to have what you need locked away back in the workshop, and even when you have time to prepare you often have to pack light. You have a particular genius when it comes to building and working with tools, gadgets, weapons, armor, and other personal scale equipment. Whether it's cramming a computing setup that would take up an entire workstation into something that a hacker can slap onto their arm for on the fly hacking, or taking a normal pistol and modding it until it's more lethal and effective than most military arms, you're able to cram a stupefying amount of effectiveness into easily ported packages. Your creativity, skills, and genius just seem to skyrocket when dealing with things in sizes that would hamper anybody else. Bigger doesn't always mean better, sometimes it just means cumbersome.


-Nanotech Wizard (Ratchet & Clank) (200CP)
        You acquire a basic understanding of the nanotech of this universe. Use it to fix yourself up when you get hurt, or use it on others. If integrated with weapons or armor, it gives them the capacity to upgrade over time and to potentially change their abilities.


-They Will Prosper (Marvel Magic) (200CP)
        Being able to make fantastical tech that can compete even with magic is all well and good, but is it really being put to optimal use if you're the only one directly benefiting from using it? You will find you have a knack for scaling personal technology to a larger size. Turn a personal shield into something that can protect an entire city or make your particle gun into a weapon of mass destruction. Of course, just because you can figure out the logistics behind increasing the scale of your technology doesn't mean you actually have the resources to make these plans into a reality -- and you can bet increasing the scale by a large degree will see a comparative increase in the cost of resources.


-Weapons Recombination Template (Final Fantasy XIII-2) (200CP)
        The shady dealer (Actually it seems like everything he's offered so far is shady) just shrugs when you pick this up. Apparently, it binds two weapons together, and allows you to shapeshift the weapon between either form. You're not quite sure how it works, but he demonstrates it to you by showing you how a bow can shift into a sword. You can't help but notice that it also turned into a Moogle afterwards...but apparently yours won't do that. Unless you throw a Moogle into the mix. Wait...does that mean...


-Factorissimo (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (300CP)
        You can make buildings that are bigger on the inside. The larger the building, the greater the ratio of inside-space to outside-space. A small warehouse could be the size of a large warehouse internally (~5x isotropic linear scaling,) while an arcology the size of an island would be the size of the entire island chain inside (~1000x isotropic linear scaling.) The main problem with these is that they have limited slots for belts or pipes to go in or out. The expansion may be non-isotropic; that is it may be scaled by more in one direction than another.
        You may also do the reverse and create a building that is smaller inside than outside, or smaller in one direction and larger in another.
        The interior and exterior sizes of these buildings are set during the design process, and are fixed for all buildings of the same type. In addition, you can place these buildings inside each other, creating recursive expanded spaces.
        You can pick one up with your Builder without breaking them. If you do this, any machinery inside is frozen in time, and any living being is ejected from space where the entrance was.


-Gadget Master (007) (300CP)
        You've been trained by Major Boothroyd at the skills of his job. You're excellent at creating and maintaining gadgets of all types. You can miniaturize nearly anything, and hide things in forms that... really shouldn't work. You can even make lasers! You're also good at coming up with ideas for unusual methods of assassination; beheading umbrellas, flamethrower bagpipes, and the like.


-Tinkerer (RWBY) (300CP)
        You're a whiz at maintaining, modifying and making things. Everything from Sniper Scythes to Toaster Ovens, as long as you made it yourself or had the blueprints on hand. Unlock the secret of Variable Weapon Crafting.


-A Matter of Scale (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (400CP)
        Let others joke about compensating, you know the engineering it takes to make war-machines function. Most devices work best in a narrow range of sizes, too big and they become unwieldy, too small and insufficiently powerful for the job. Either way efficiency drops off sharpy. Not for you. You can scale up weapons to level cities and slay Titans, or miniaturize them almost to the point of digi-weapons with no loss of functionality, and can do this for virtually any technology.


-Data Compression (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
        As an artificial intelligence being able to move, alter, and compress data is something more than a hobby for you, it is a way of life. As such you are so good at compressing data without harming its function that you could fit an entire artificial intelligence onto a pocket calculator if you had too and it would still work! Copying an entire database to fit onto a usb stick? SIMPLE. Be careful however the internal memory basically works as the life span of an AI, when it runs out the AI dies. Besides you never know when someone may catch on to your little tricks...


-Dimensional Addition or Subtraction (Generic Builder) (400CP)
        While any Builder's claimed space may be stretched or limited according to the Builder's ability and preferences, you have an exceptional knack for expanding or shrinking the space inside of your claimed areas, chests that have several rooms inside of them, police boxes that are the size of a large house, a forest that has trails that are merely a block or two when they should be far longer or even turning that child's backyard into an entire magical forest with enough skill.


-Hybridization Theory (Zoids Legacy) (400CP)
        So one day you had a bit of spare time after your daily Zoid admiration hour. After taking a close look at your favorite Gojulas and your favorite Mad Thunder, you decided that if the Gojulas could wield the Mad Thunder's Magnesser Drills like an arm weapon, you could probably reenact that scene from the show you watched two days back on the professor's hi-def television. Those mechanics can slap on parts and scavenge however they like. You can literally merge two machines together into one, with twice the processing power as before. Mind you, Zoids typically won't respond well to suddenly sharing a body with another core and another mind, but you'll have ethical uses for this...right? For most mundane machinery, you don't need any power source besides your own, but be careful that should you make your machine too big, the internal power supply might not be enough to feed it.


-Macro Scale Engineering (GALACTA DAUGHTER OF GALACTUS) (400CP)
        So. Other species' science. Not that great. Really not that great. Even the ones that think they're amazing have a habit of being really inconsiderate about what size they make their stuff for. Thankfully, as a Plus Times One Million sized badass, you can fix it for them. Your existing mind is a marvel already but now you have a particular talent for scaling up existing science, magic and other devices or creations to a outright silly scale. You can even work a human sized mutant being into a planet scale organism that retains all the normal powers and intelligence of the original! Best of all, you're able to make your scaled up pet projects workable. They won't tear themselves apart from being made massively larger and stronger or unravel at the seams. They will probably need to really guzzle down the calories/energies now that they're so much bigger. But it's not hard to just get some pet food energy. What are stars for after all.


-Miniaturization/Efficiency (Worm) (400CP)
        You can miniaturize anything down to levels that any sane man would consider impossible. A fusion reactor the size of a watch battery would be the absolute minimum of what you are capable of, and you'd be able to make it far smaller than that. Your power also makes you a master of technological efficiency, anything you make needing barely any energy to run compared to what it should and continue to do so for a very long time. These specialties also make you a master of nanotechnology and similar pursuits. Of course you aren't barred from building something big like a giant robot, just that it'll be impossibly efficient and crammed full of more weapons and subsystems then should be possible


-Profound Seal Storage Treasure Techniques (Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension) (400CP)
        While true understanding of the Dao of Space is something only possessed by Immortals, there are techniques available to those of lower cultivation which still come in handy. Knowledge of this particular technique allows you to create small pocket dimensions linked to objects, effectively allowing large and powerful effects and items to be contained within a small space. This also could be viewed as a mystical form of miniaturization, shrinking things to one-thousandth of their usual size, possibly smaller in higher cultivation realms or with comprehension of the Dao of Space.


-Sleek and Efficient (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (400CP)
        Like a multi-tool, your creations are capable of containing many features in a small package. This isn't true miniaturization; you're not quite at the point where you could shove a moon-sized super laser into a wristwatch. Your wristwatch could, however, have a regular sized laser, as well as a decent computer and several other minor bits and bobs.


-Sohon (Legacy of the Aldenata) (400CP)
        Sohon is the semi-spiritual technique used by the Indowy to build all the best Galactic technology (like, for example, ACS). Sohon adepts are incredibly rare; of all 18 trillion Indowy, only a few hundred have the potential to become a user of Sohon at all. A Sohon adept mentally controls nanites in a special tank to grow the technology under their direction, allowing for chemical structures and molecular formations that... really shouldn't happen. While you'll never be a true adept (never ranking, for example, among human Mentats), you can at least utilize the basics, allowing you to repair Galactic tech and, with a lot of time and effort, maybe make a little of your own.


-Nanite Sciences | Nanite Removal and Control (Generator Rex) (500CP)
        Nanite Sciences (100CP)
        You possess in depth knowledge of nanite technologies. With sufficient equipment and resources you could produce and control nanite machines, possibly even recreate the nanite event or maybe figure out how to reverse its effects. But that would take a long time of additional study of nanites out in the world, still you might be one of the few who could attempt this endeavor. You possess no knowledge of the meta-nanites, and understanding how they work is beyond your grasp.
        Nanite Removal and Control (400CP)
        Many in this world would consider this is your most important ability, you can control nanites and absorb them into yourself, reverting dangerous mutations and can help people regain control of themselves. At first however this power will only work on willing targets, and will not work on incurable, especially virulent nanite infested EVOs. However with training and time, your powers can grow to circumvent these rules. Your greatest limitation is the fact that as you absorb nanites your reservoirs fill to the breaking point, causing dangerous flare ups and rendering your abilities unstable. You can purge these nanities, but figuring out how to do so in a safe way with a large amount of unstable nanites may take some effort. After this Jump your nanites can be used to heal people, whether of wounds, diseases, or possibly even mutations or others turned into a monster. Success will vary depending on factors, a mystical curse is probably beyond your nanites, a really out of this world super virus might be cured, but that's iffy. If you happen to run into other nanites in other jumps, you could control and manipulate them as well.


-Bigger is Always Better (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (600CP)
        You're a true visionary, even amongst the most celebrated of your peers your creations would be known as truly awe-inspiring things. Grace, realism, detail, you are almost unsurpassed in all areas. But you have a certain specialisation, one more suited for a Necrotect than any other. The bigger it is, the more complex it is, the easier it is for you to make it. The larger the tomb and more intricate its design, the less time it takes for you to have fully working plans drawn up. Even the actual construction becomes easier in the same way, with larger and larger constructions seeming to be more and more fortunate. Extra supplies turn up out of nowhere, the slaves are in perpetual good moods and shortcuts tha cut time and resources needed without lowering quality are found aplenty.


-Mini Machines (Supergod) (600CP)
        Advanced technology might be the basis of most superhumans but what if you can't skip all that and just fit a machine the size of a factory into a man's arm so he can break a castle with his fist? Pretty neat, I'd say. You have the ability to miniaturise technology to an incredible degree, fitting machines the size of small buildings into the hand or head of an ordinary human, without facing any loss in efficiency or effectiveness. If you then make them at the usual size, they'll be far better than they usually would as you pack so much into them. You're also incredibly skilled at fitting these machines you've made into the biology of living beings, creating effective and viable cyborgs.


-Prototyper (The Polity) (600CP)
        You're more than capable of inventing new and novel systems that integrate existing technologies in startlingly effective ways. Any fool can make a laser or a missile bigger; what you do is combine different technologies in new and inventive ways ; they thought Tenkian was a genius? Well he's got nothing on you. Whoever thought putting a shear-field on a missile was going to work? Here, you'll find inspiration for combining the Polity's technologies in new ways hardfields, antimatter devices, artificial gravity, AI subminds, Under-space tech, all the neat stuff even Pradortech. The technology of the Jain, Csorians and Atheter are still beyond you, however. After this jump, your inspiration works to combine different technologies from completely different origins into new devices, and removes the restriction on Jain/Csorian/Atheter tech.


-Pym's Protege (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (600CP)
        You can synthesize and utilize Pym Particles to achieve scientific wonders; increasing or decreasing objects and living creatures in size, density, and weight. The exact details of how Pym Particles work are a bit fuzzy, perhaps even to Pym himself, but they seem to have near limitless potential. Growth for living beings is capped at around the size of a large building, while shrinking can go down to subatomic levels- inorganic things could potentially grow or shrink even further, but at extreme size differences the amount of Pym Particles required to sustain that size may outpace the benefit. As an added bonus, you'll also learn about Hank's ant controlling technology.


-They're Like Legos, Right? | This Is How I Want It (Kerbal Space Program) (600CP)
        They're Like Legos, Right? (200CP)
        There's robust engineering, and then there's modularity. Pick one. Except for you - you seem to have the gift of designing methods that allow for seamless mixing and matching of modular technology that lack none of the parts incompatibility and fragility you'd except from such a design paradigm. While this seems focused on Kerbin technology in specific, a little work should have you applying such a paradigm to all sorts of technologies...
        This Is How I Want It (400CP)
        Your capability of mentally designing items is vastly boosted. It's almost as if you have a mental idea space in the fashion of a construction bay with a lists of parts you have on hand that gives you an idea of what you can build at that moment... actually, that's pretty much what you have. As a bonus, you can mix and match parts in a manner roughly akin to legos, and giving you an idea of what would work and what wouldn't (and how much resources it would take to build). Mind, this doesn't mean that your mental creation will perform successfully, but it will function. As a final bonus, you can mentally hand-off the resultant creation to your Kerbals to build, and they'll do so without a mistake or screwup - meaning any snafu that results will be on your own head.


-CHEAT MODE - School for Ants (SimAnt) (1000CP)
        Miniature schools, tiny dojos and nano computers oh my! If you have the materials, then it becomes child's-play for you to build ant sized mechanical equipment as long as you have the materials available to you. Who knows what you can accomplish if you are already decently capable with minimization techniques?


-Nano-Technician | Nanoforge (Red Faction) (1200CP)
        Nano-Technician (600CP)
        Is it me or does nanomachines not sound like a word anymore? You now have a considerable talent in the field of nanotech. With time and study, you could recreate the Nanoforge, with dedication you could even improve on it. Keep in mind nanotech in this setting is exceptionally hard to work with, but can do anything from fixing a bridge, to disintegrating a starship, to enhancing human abilities.
        Nanoforge (600CP)
        Typically worn around the wrist, this device is an engineer's wet dream. Using real-time scans provided by the onboard AI, the Nano-Forge emits nanites as either a proximity cloud or projectile globs that procedurally recreate objects nearby. This Nano-Forge is restricted to repair functionality, and it doesn't work on biological material, but it does have the precision to recreate delicate electronics and the like.
