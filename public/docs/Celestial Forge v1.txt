Spells are fun and all, but there's nothing quite like the full feeling of wielding a physical weapon or to be clad in armor that looks as good as it performs. Or what about making upgrades to those vehicles or mechs that you love, ensuring they stay relevant along your journey? There's so many different things that can be done to ensure your gear keeps up. As such, we're going to explain the Celestial Forge, which will be meant to give you the tools to just about make any machine, weapon, or armor you could damn well desire.
 
We'll start with the following:
 
-Workshop (Warehouse)
-Garage (Fast and Furious)
-Hangar (Ace Combat)
-Architect's Eye (LOSS)
-Scanner (Iji)
-Omnitool (Mass Effect)
-Tool Kit (Macross)
-Striker Artificer Toolkit (Strike Witches)
-Ars Creation Tools (Blazblue)
-Micromanipulators (Raildex Science)
-AGE System (Gundam AGE)
-Orgel of Origins (Ar Tonelico)
-Diagnostic Tools (Outlaw Star)
-Kinesis/Stasis Module (Dead Space)
-The Toolkit (Sabaton)
-Volcanic Forge (God of War)
-Armor-Shift Manufacture (Bloody Roar)
-Skyforge (The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim)
-Mythical Forge (Jade Empire)
-Workshop (Bubblegum Crisis)
-Laboratorium (Light of Terra)
-Lathe-Wrought Armour Plating Kit (Light of Terra)
-Advanced Materials Upgrade Kit (Light of Terra)
-Crucible of Eight Trigrams (Journey to the West)
-Launderer System (No More Heroes)
-Workshop (Samurai Jack)
-Hidden Hideaway/Laboratory (Valkyria Chronicles)
-Soul of the Forge (World of Warcraft)
-Orb Design Plans (Swat Kats)
-Workshop Equipment (Bloodborne)
-Workshop/3D Fabricator (GUNNM)
-Alchemical Foundry/Mythic Forge/Dust Refinery/Arcane Smelter (Endless Legend)
-Alchemy Workshop (Endless Legend)
-The Alchemy Machine (Shivers)
-The Mixing Cauldron/Melting Pot/Spirit Pyroxene/Goldberg Formula/Daisy Chain/Vortex (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Workshop (Dark Cloud 2)
-Prismatic Laboratory (Fallen London)
-Alchemy Machine (Spiral Knights)
-Alchemy Machines (SBURB)
 
TOOLKITS. So many damn toolkits. We can't work on things if we don't have the tools! So many toolkits, from Sabaton to Macross to Blazblue and more! We want to be able to make sure we can work on every kind of machine we possibly can, from weapons to armor to vehicles to mech pieces. This is supposed to be a forge, and damn if anything is going to be exempt from this process. This means we're going to be raiding 'Hangars' from Ace Combat, 'Workshops' from Samurai Jack, Bloodborne, Dark Cloud 2 and Bubblegum Crisis, even so far as a 'Garage'! Car tools are good tools! Of course we also have to ensure the more... esoteric functions are handled, so a 'Prismatic Laboratory' would be nice if only to supplement the work we possess.
 
But there are also very specific tools we need. 'Crucible of Eight Trigrams' and 'Alchemy Workshop' to study and look over the magical effects of enchanted weapons, along with 'Scanner', 'Orb Design Plans', and 'Diagnostic Tools' to study what kind of advanced technology is in something... but we can throw in things from the 'Laboratorium' to further increase the scanning and studying of something. With all this data we'll be getting, we can sufficiently use the 'AGE System' in order to take all that data and help us construct parts and items on demand! Mythic Forges and Arcane Smelters to handle magical ores and items, but to be safe we'll use 'Architect's Eye' to ensure EVERYTHING is up to snuff. After all, what if you need a super efficient containment center to hold super hot magical fires or something?
 
Speaking of magical fires and the like, we have the 'Mixing Cauldron', a wonderful alchemical tool. It can be used for potions and other things, being a workshop and research station all in one. 'Spirit Pyroxene' allows for anything we make to be more conductive to spiritual energies, while 'Melting Pot' lets us mix things that could not normally be mixed with a higher degree. 'Goldberg Formula' makes it evolve quite a bit, turning it into a system and allowing it to be something MORE while 'Daisy Chain' makes multiple mini-cauldrons to further improve Synthesis and complex multi-tier creations! 'The Vortex' only makes it even better, with blending things more efficiently and even storing an effect! This is beyond useful. Simply beyond useful. ...and as if we didn't have MORE bullshit, 'The Alchemy Machine' from Shivers improves all alchemical effects, along with 'Crucible of Eight Trigrams' to disassemble something to copy/store a magical enchantment to replicate it! Tossing in 'Alchemical Foundry' and its derivatives from 'Endless Legend', along with the 'Alchemy Machine' from Spiral Knights to accept all kinds of materials and recipes, and we're cooking with Uranium. Speaking of which, we can make that literal with the 'Alchemy Machines' from SBURB, letting us mix and synthesize various materials together for our own purposes!
 
'Micromanipulator' technology in the gloves are also needed, to ensure we do not mess up on even the slightest of details. A 'Mythical Forge' from Jade Empire to ensure anything we make is drastically improved. 'Kinesis' and 'Stasis Modules' to guarantee we can move even the largest of items and 'freeze' them at precise moments when needed. Even an 'Armor-Shift Manufacture' to ensure any 'armor' might fit properly regardless of alt-form, as it is poor to make an armor too tight or too large. 'Plating and Upgrade' kits from Light of Terra will let us upgrade weapons and armor to be much greater in quality and durability as well, especially if we use any magical ores.
 
But the primary thing to keep here? The 'Soul of the Forge' pet one can get from the Warlords of Draenor expansion from World of Warcraft. It is described as ‘A spirit that manifests as a small, cyclopean golem made of molten metal and shards, the Soul of the Forge dwells within the workshops and smithies of metalworkers. So long as it is content, all who work within that forge’s walls will find their creations blessed: The individual pieces, parts, and techniques required coming together that much easier, and the end result being that much more splendid.’ In order for the Soul of the Forge to dwell, one also requires a small kiln to house the spirit. But we'll naturally make a MUCH better kiln, and allow the Soul of the Forge to sustain itself as much as needed on the Garden's energies. These along with letting them help with every project and ore should help keep them happy.
 
But we also need the knowledge of machines:
 
-Certified Tech (Fallout)
-Tech Expert (Starcraft)
-Machinist (Skies of Arcadia)
-Analysis (Red Alert 3)
-Whispered (Full Metal Panic)
-Machines, They Just Speak To Me (Firefly)
-Analysis (Adventure Time)
-Engineer/Erudition (Halo)
-Not A Stupid Grunt (Mass Effect)
-Technomage (Strike Witches)
-Ancient Knowledge (Mysterious Cities of Gold)
-Gadgeteering (Blazblue)
-Independent Innovation (Gundam AGE)
-Build That Wall (Bastion)
-upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!! (Red Faction)

-Demigod Atelier (Asura's Wrath)
-Grease Monkey (Bubblegum Crisis)
-The Plecian Tome (Light of Terra)
-The Maddest Science Yet! (Tenchi Muyo)
-Inventor (Futurama)
-Reverse Engineering (Sekirei)
-Xenospecialist (Gears of War)
-Valkyrian Science (Valkyria Chronicles)
-I Am Iron Man/Retro-Engineer (MCU)
-Etoria Disciple (Final Fantasy XII)
-Holy Forge (Hellgate London)
-Technician (Alpha Cenaturi)
-Engineering (Teen Titans)
-Orokin Tech (Warframe)
-An Order To Things (Gunnerkrigg Court)
-Arch-Magos (40k Redux)
-Feel It Out (F.E.A.R.)
-Damaged Microchip (Terminator)
-What's This Do? (Titanfall)
-Xenotechnology (STALKER)
-Technician/Core Competence (Spiral Knights)
-Pagan Science (Senki Zesshou Symphogear)
-Fitting into a Mould: Scientist (Gravity Rush)
-Peak ADVENT Technology (XCOM 2)
-Hands of Icarus (Heaven's Lost Property)
 
Various 'Analysis' perks along with understanding perks such as 'An Order To Things', 'Xenospecialist', 'Certified Tech', 'Independent Innovation', 'upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!!', 'Tech Expert', 'Xenotechnology' and 'Xenoarchaeologist' will let us essentially understand about anything we find with enough time. But just to be safe, 'Retro-Engineer', 'Reverse Engineering' and 'Whispered' will even the odds a fair amount more. After all, we need to make sure we can understand ANYTHING we see here in time, because how can we be expected to understand... or even improve upon the technology that we see if we cannot so much as grasp its basic natures?
 
Things like 'Erudition', 'Demigod Atelier', 'Orokin Tech', 'Arch-Magos', and 'The Divine Machines' will also guarantee our technology is EXTREMELY advanced, to the point of clarketech. After all, if we're trying to forge items of supreme wonder it should be supremely advanced! Even swords are no exception. We're going to make sure even a simple dagger will achieve artifact-status. Throwing in 'The Plecian Tome' for reference along with 'Valkyrian Science', 'Hard Science', and 'The Maddest Science Yet!' only improves this possibility and potential. There's additional assistance as well, from minor things like 'Technomage', 'Holy Forge', and Star Trek 'Skills' to round off what we can make. Even down to 'Fitting into a Mould: Scientist' to ensure we can fuck with gravity and adaptation technology.
 
But we're not one to go to straight clarketech. We need the basics. 'Gadgeteering', 'Engineering', 'Grease Monkey', 'I Am Iron Man', 'Machinist', and more will let us get nitty gritty with more 'modern' styles of technology or even archaic versions. No form of technology should be outside of our purview, nor should they be discarded. After all, you never know when you're going to need to make something more... acceptable for the time period you are in, or if you need to make a part or machine a very specific way to avoid any issues.
 
But sometimes we want to go bigger. Not everything is handheld, after all.

-Consummate Knowledge/Swiss Army Engineer (Ring of Red)
-Aerospace Engineering Makes Things Go Fast (Kerbal Space Program)
 
Vehicles! Larger weapons! Gun platforms! MECHS. All of these things and more are what plenty of people think of when they say 'superior firepower'. Often times it is the size of the weapon that gives it its power. So we should be willing to oblige by that fact. 'The Good Doctor', along with 'Superweapons' and 'Technical Certainties' would let us make such large weapons platforms to do battle with. It would undoubtedly take time, but we most certainly know how to make them. 'Technical Certainties' can also let us work on fighter jets, along with 'Fingers of Silver', while 'Aerospace Engineering Makes Things Great' can let us figure out all the technical know-hows of aerospace and flying through the sky and space. Sometimes we want some seriously good planes to go around and fuck shit up with.
 
But what about the mechs? 'MT/AC Engineering' with 'Core Competence', 'Anaheim Degree', 'Valuable Memories', 'Techy', 'Consummate Knowledge'/'Swiss Army Engineer', and 'A New Age of Warfare' will at least ensure we have more than enough capability to engage in creating mech designs to act as mobile weapons platforms... or just to punch the shit out of things, it's really up to you. Either option is valid. 'I Like 'Em Big'/'Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds' will let us design healthy, FIT mechs as well. But at least this way along with 'Tech Mastermind' you can make mechs of any size, all to be able to wreck the enemy. Of course, 'Mechanic' will at least let us get an 'in' for constructing vehicles as well, but 'Alpha Documents' will let us make... some truly fucked up stuff. Black Hole Generators, gravity systems, psychic pilot machinery, the works. But hey, nothing wrong with MORE MAGIC, which is what the 'Extensive Research Notes' are for! Magical mech armors!
 
But now we have a problem. With all these construction times and the size of these things, we need a way to make sure we get it done on time! It's not going to work if we spend entire years working on the same mech or car. Time is precious! That's why we get some help:
 
-Don't Need A Team (Ace Combat)
-One-Man Assembly Line (XCOM)
-Machinist (Gargoyles)
-Most Holy Order of the Socket Wrench (Fast and Furious)
-We Need Reserves/Special Attention (Gundam AGE)
-Savvy Sultan (Macross)
-Shipping the Product (F.E.A.R.)
-Build Rome (Gundam: After Colony)
-Workaholic (Sonic)
-Researcher (Age of Mythology)
-Scientist: Machinery/Strong Spark (Girl Genius)
-Manufacturing Line (Valkyria Chronicles)
 
We speed things up while maintaining function and form. These are worth their weight in GOLD. 'One-Man Assembly Line', 'Don't Need a Team', 'Machinist', and 'Savvy Sultan' are all very powerful in that not only does it speed these things up, but lets us do the work that would normally take an entire team to produce! It's all very very nice. 'Researcher' and 'Manufacturing Line' also speed things up considerably, with 'Workaholic' meaning we either can produce the results fivefold, or make it even BETTER in that short time. When we need speed, we are covered. Even better, 'We Need Reserves'/'Special Attention' has that wonderful combo where we can pump out HIGH QUALITY items.
 
But now that we have the knowledge and we have the materials, along with the speed... we need to actual crafting. We have quite a bit, fortunately:
 
-I Can Fix It! (Reborn)
-Engineer (Super Mario RPG)
-Smith (Gothic)
-Dwarven Craft (Lord of the Rings)
-High-Frequency Manufacturer (Metal Gear Rising)

-Workshop Artisan (Bloodborne)
-Fingers of the North Star (Cave Story)
-Gadgetron License (Ratchet & Clank)
-Crystal Metallurgy (Final Fantasy XIV)
-The Arcane Craft (Sword and Sorcery)
 
Time to get to work! 'Crafting Genius' certainly helps us with a jack of all trades, but 'Master Craftsman' and 'Engineer' will ensure we can work on about any handheld item, be it leather or metal. 'Gadgetron License' with 'Infinitely Customizeable', 'Customized Weapons', 'Weapons Modifications', and 'I Can Fix It!' are all all-encompassing perks that will improve our customization as well as the variety of equipment we can work with.
 
'Dwarven Craft', 'Blessing of Dundr', 'Tempered Soul', 'Blacksmithing' 'Workshop Artisan', and other smithing skills can let us get down to the nitty gritty of armor and weapons! The archaic forms of combat, but they do still have a very nice style to them. They also can be adapted for modern times to invoke an image, which can be quite powerful indeed. Even better, 'High-Frequency Manufacture' can let us give a modern adaptation to swords, helping them slice through metal as though it were paper!
 
'Armorsmith' from Light of Terra can let us work on some modern views of armor along with the normal stint we can think of, which is all fine! If you want to keep with the times yet look like a medieval badass this is the way to go. 'Crystal Metallurgy' can let us utilize crystals in the creation of some of the armor as well, which can let us absorb magic to slowly repair it! For anyone who has magic, it's pretty badass. Of course, magic itself is awesome, so 'The Arcane Craft' is awesome to make sure we can actually make such magical items and artifacts that can do wonders... or augment magical power if they're a mage already.
 
'Fingers of the North Star', 'Weapon Crafting', 'Bandit Gunsmith', and 'Gunsmith' will ensure we can craft just about anything, from pistols to assault rifles to sniper rifles to SMGs, even the occasional rocket launcher if we really want to make sure of it. You never know, we might need it. But generally we should be sticking to hand-held rifles... or bolters. Who knows, someone may want a nice bolter to blast someone with. Guns are just as important as blades, after all.
 
But weapons and armor are just part of the equation. What about... clothes?
 
-Talented: Tailoring (Inukami)
-Tailoring/Life Fibers (Kill la Kill)
-Crafting Genius (Final Fantasy XI)
-Garment Gloves (Dodgeball)
-Sea Snail Shells (Splatoon)
-Secular Skills (Red Dwarf)
-Profession: Tailoring (World of Warcraft)
-Fashion Nonvictim (The World Ends With You)
-Fashion (High School of the Dead)
-Juggernaut (Terraria)
-Avid Glove (Fallen London)
-Micromanipulators (Raildex Science)
-Coordinated Outfits (Kingdom of Loathing)
-The Flock's Fleece (Actraiser)
-Putting On The Reich (Indiana Jones)
-Tailor Made (Skullduggery Pleasant)
-Requiem of Souls/Weaver/Silk Spinning (Jade Cocoon)
 
We can most definitely make clothes. We can make so many clothes it's ridiculous, ranging from normal attire to fashionable uniforms. Granted, with Life Fibers we're going to be able to make anything pretty damn powerful or nice. But with armor, why would we need clothes? Well, firstly with 'Profession: Tailoring' from World of Warcraft along with 'Life Fibers' and the 'Tailoring' skill needed, our clothes will always give an AMAZING bonus. We can also use additional tailoring with the godly ability of 'Weaver' and 'Silk Spinning', which is not only letting us spin some absurdly high-quality silk, but can let us turn cocooned monsters into silk that we've placed in with 'Requiem of Souls'! Adding the 'Garment Gloves' from Dodgeball into the 'Micromanipulators' to channel the skills of such godly tailoring along with the 'Avid Glove' into as well, we can do no wrong.
 
Secondly, we have 'Fashion Nonvictim' and 'Fashion'... which are frankly amazing perks. When you wear an armor piece like a shoulder plate, or gauntlets, or little pieces like that? The armor piece gives its full protection and properties to the rest of the clothes as though they were the armor themselves! Then we toss on 'Juggernaut' to make it half-again as effective as it could be, with 'The Flock's Fleece' providing even more protection with no loss to comfort! We can then throw in 'Tailor Made' to imbue it with magic and make it even MORE powerful... it's really amazing and opens so many options it's ridiculous. Never look bad ever again! We can even make this more bullshit with 'Coordinated Outfits', which makes it so if we have a theme to our outfit it increases the power within. The best part is we can add three slots to hats, shoes, and shirts thanks to 'Sea Snail Shells' to further modify them! Talk about fun times!
 
But this isn't the end. Now is when the magic happens.

-Advanced Materials (XCOM 2)
 
In our case? Literally. We want to ensure we can make our armor and our weapons are as magical as fuck. Or maybe technologically advanced, who knows! Various magics would allow us to enchant these items with even small effects... but sometimes these small effects work wonders. Minor enchantments, normal enchantments, elven enchantments, even simple magical effects thanks to the power of infusing magic into these creations. Even better, 'Magitek Mastery' makes it so these weapons and items are partially magical in nature, improving their effects tremendously! Of course if we want to benefit with magic even more, 'Material Hybridization' can let us make metal out of any magical element, with 'Inner Linings' allowing us to stick little lines inside our wearable gear to stack enchantments like mad! Fun times all around.
 
There is always ways to improve. 'Soul Smith' fortunately only needs to replace souls with Spiritual Energy in order to do work, albeit at a greater cost... and wouldn't you know, we have some. This works well with 'Glove of the East' to make these items as spiritual as FUCK. While we're at it, 'That Undefinable Thing' allows it so our items can be powered by soul power AND becomes innate to the person using them, which may help to making sure no one else can use it. Why go for spiritual if we have magical, though? Well, why NOT. Never underestimate the power of spirituality, especially when we've seen how it goes in some of these worlds.
 
'Artifice' along with 'Crafting' can ensure these items are not only magical in nature, but can even slowly 'heal' themselves and self-repair over time! 'Artificer' even lets us reduce the time and cost of what we need! For artifacts such as these, this is an immeasurable trait that is worth its weight in many rare substances. 'Maker's Prodigy' and 'Maker' will also ensure these items can be imbued with power and of superb quality. But there's always technology we can add on... 'Universally Upgradeable' along with 'Device Meister', 'Celestial Technology', and 'Ars Magus/Armagus Creation' can help us with even the greatest of technological functions along with the prior perks. Let nothing be outside of upgrades!
 
But what about slots? We can't go around without slots, it's practically the pride and joy! 'Transcendence', along with 'Universally Upgradeable' and 'Blood Artisan Plus' can let us start dropping anything from power nodes to blood gems to cards/materia/WoW gems and other such wonderful little toys. This ensures that no matter what we actually MAKE, that we're going to be able to further upgrade it as we make more things. Good thing Mythical Forge from Jade Empire can let us create gems, huh?
 
But alas, there's more to consider. 'Solar Harnessing' and 'Atlantean Power Crystals' for the day time and 'Moon Orb' for the night time if we get the two mixed and installed at least lets us make sure that our items and equipment can take in energy from ANY time of the day. Cloud cover might be an issue, but at the least we'll be able to go for quite a long time. But the REAL kicker? 'Weapon Absorption' and 'Weapon Synthesis'. The first one lets our items actually grow from experience and self-improve from battle ALONG with absorbing other weapons into the base template, which is an amazing kicker in of itself. We'll even add the 'Augment Blade System' and 'Heretical Adaptation' to it in order to amplify its ability to grow. But 'Weapon Synthesis'? We can crystallize a weapon, then pass ANY ONE PROPERTY into another item. We can then use 'Self-Made Shopkeeper' beforehand on it to make sure a SECOND trait was passed on. Then we can throw on 'Advanced Materials' to make it much easier for us to figure out how to merge different materials together for even more combinations! Do you have any idea how amazing that is? It's fucking amazing.
 
But want to know what's even more amazing? Making our items look amazing and be of GODLY quality:

First we need to be able to make them AMAZING starting out. 'Craftsman of the Gods', along with 'Master Craftsman', 'We Need Reserves'/'Special Attention', 'Mechanical Master', and 'Maker's Prodigy'/'Maker' in order to make them as amazing as we possibly can. If there was ever a time of gods, these things should be items fit for the LEADER. To further emphasize this, everything from Percy Jackson should help with this. A 'Minor Blessing' or two, 'Unnatural Skill', and 'Divine Child' due to literally being a child of Hephaestus from that world will ensure at the very minimum our crafting work is nothing short of divine. This along with 'Chosen of Death' will guarantee nothing but perfection.
 
Buuuut if we wanted to be funny, then we can do 'Material Synthesis Science' to make even BETTER materials as long as we're in a zero-gravity environment, with 'Exotic Compatibility' letting us utilize exotic materials in our work! As if to make this even better, 'Form and Function' can let us slide in little layers of crystal inside our wearable equipment so that we can make a weave that DRAMATICALLY increases durability... and 'Innovator' can let us be far more likely to succeed regarding our creations. On top of that, 'Ambrosial Artificer' and 'Fixer Upper' will ensure we can discard unneeded parts while improving the ones we DO need! We need this so badly it's sick, especially when combining those with the 'Lathe of Heaven' ability that lets us maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses, along with 'Engineering Iteration' allowing us to increase improvements of parts up to 50%-75%... well. Let's just say we're really playing for keeps. We can even take our time and 'Do One Thing At A Time', which means it so if we focus on a single task, time taken is halved and the quality doubles!
 
The Mythical Forge from Jade Empire will further provide a base to augment anything we may have. 'Technical Expertise' along with 'Remodelling', 'Expert Smithing', 'Soul Smith' and 'Glove of the East' along with 'Maker's Prodigy' and 'Soulcraft' in tandem can allow us to augment these weapons and armor and items, making them far better than they should be starting out, while the improved 'Feel It Out' lets us improve and attune things to psionic abilities! Yeah it's nice making something amazing starting out, but we also love upgrading things to keep up with things. On top of that, 'Deity's Weapon' and 'Weapon Synthesis' both from Warriors Orochi can ensure that the more we use something or try to draw it out, the better enhanced it will become and the more its inherent properties will be magnified. Why SHOULDN'T we be able to upgrade it as a result? We can even throw on some 'Mythril Coating' to make it improve the duration of energy-draining forms for twice as long, while crafting steel weapons with 'Secrets of Steel' and transfer the properties with perks listed above! Guarantee that whatever leaves our workshop will be nothing less than a divine artwork.
 
Speaking of art, it needs to look GOOD as well. 'Decadence', 'Aesthetic', 'Aesthetics and Flair', 'Pure Art', and 'Chosen of Death' can ensure whatever we make will be of the utmost quality in APPEARANCE as well! Whatever we touch is going to LOOK amazing at the very minimum, with 'Tailor Made' ensuring we don't even need to take any extra time out of it! Even better, 'Accessory Machine' can be used to attach other wonderful works onto something to make it awesome. 'Secular Skills' and 'My Fashion Sense Is Tingling' ensures we can make any clothes look amazing, while 'Stylish Mechanic' ensures whatever mechs we make just looks damned NICE. Which is fair, appearance is half the battle.
 
But what if there's a style we like already? Easy enough! 'Armsfusion Crafter' allows us to use them to combine, getting all the looks with all the stats as well! We can get the best of both worlds for this, which is just amazing in of itself. All while 'Transmogrification' and 'Clothing Skinner' can let us take the style of something else, then apply it to the item in question. I'm not entirely sure how the hell this works, but at this point I'm not sure I'll complain.
 
But with all the things we're going to be throwing on... size is going to be an issue. A huge issue. Let's fix that.

-Specialty: Mechanics/Engineering (Transformers)
-Master Builder (Transformers)
-Miniaturization/Efficiency (Worm)
-Nanite Sciences/Nanite Removal and Control (Generator Rex)
-Nano-technician/Nanoforge (Red Faction)
-Sohon (Legacy of the Aldenata)
-Weapons Recombination Template (Final Fantasy XIII-2)
-Hybridization Theory (Zoids: Legacy)
-Nanotech Wizard (Ratchet & Clank)
-Prototyper (Polity)
-They're Like Legoes, Right?/This Is How I want It (Kerbal Space Program)
 
'Gadget Master', along with 'Miniaturization/Efficiency' can allow us to shrink our technology to some impressive sizes, all while maintaining their efficiency that they would have had at larger sizes. Which is good, but we can do better. 'Tinkerer' along with 'Weapons Recombination Template' and 'Hybridization Theory' can let us merge together various technologies into a single object, albeit one with transformative abilities. But anything to save space, right? We'll also throw in 'Prototyper' to ACTUALLY be able to mix and combine different technologies together, to ensure maximum efficiency.
 
But wait! There's more. Transformation? We've got our 'Specialty' perks and 'Master Builder' from Transformers, who are more or less MASTERS of metallic shapeshifting/changing. Utilizing trace amounts of Transformium can at least help ease the burden of the constant shapeshifting we may be giving our items or mechs, which we are desperately in need of. But suppose we had more means to make things smaller or efficient. We can also use 'They're Like Legoes, Right?' and 'This Is How I Want It' to design some truly absurd modular technology, which will be in demand if we want to save space on whatever we create.
 
One word: Nanotech. Turns out we've got a hell of a lot in regards to that. 'Nano-technician', 'Nanite Sciences', and 'Nanotech Wizard' gives us some pretty good knowledge and skill in regards to actually creating and maintaining this nanotechnology, with 'Nanoforge' giving us quite the ample supply... even if we may need to just link it to the 'AGE System' to ensure it's of sufficient quality. But is this the end? Hell no. 'Sohon' is a special, semi-spiritual technique that allows us to mentally control Nanotechnology in order to form some DAMNED impressive shapes! In truth it's actually really nice, and combined with 'Nanite Removal and Control' will help us significantly for the finer details.
 
But there are other details we need to consider. Like using resources and durability:
 
-Waste Not (Monster Hunter)
-More With Less (XCOM)
-Mauler (Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars)
-Scavenger (Squirrel and Hedgehog)
-Armsthrift (Fire Emblem: Awakened)
-The Honed Edge (Pocky & Rocky)
-Robust Engineering (Dune)
-Built to Last (Assassin's Creed)
-Salvager (Babylon 5)
-Crimson Weapons (Etrian Odyssey)
-Lack of Materials (God of War)
-Repair Savvy (Outlaw Star)
-Shipping the Product (F.E.A.R.)
-Gadgeteer (Totally Spies)
-Panzerkampf/Firestorm (Sabaton)
-Super Scientific Solution (Tenchi Muyo)
-Efficiency (Lego: Ninjango)
-Ambrosial Artificer (Macross)
-Reuseable Resources/Artificial Alloys (Anno 2070)
-Reliable Invention (Kim Possible)
-Scavenger (Megaman Zero)
-Manufacturing Line (Valkyria Chronicles)
-upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!! (Red Faction)
-Scrapyard Skills (Swat Kats)
-Element Analysis (Bomberman 64: The Second Attack)
-Harmless Extraction/Extraction Efficiency/Rapid Growth (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Cold Fires (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Composition Analysis (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Acquester (Spiral Knights)
-Rationing (Mad Max)
-Scrapper (Fallout 4)
 
So MANY different ways we can cut down on resources and issues. 'Waste Not' along with 'More With Less' from XCOM and 'Scavenger' from Squirrel and Hedgehog, and 'Rationing' from Mad Max will ensure we can use as LITTLE materials as we possible can in order to cut down on requirements. Of course, 'Manufacturing Line' also cuts down and lets us use half the required materials as well, which is good! At the same time, 'Efficiency' with 'Gadgeteer' let us make sure we are never wasteful. Ever. When working with materials like this, we cannot afford ANY waste. Not even with fire, as 'Cold Fires' can let us decrease the temperatures needed to forge something.
 
'Element Analysis' and 'Composition Analysis' can help us by analyzing materials and breaking them down to base elements to use, with 'Reuseable Resources' helping us by letting us reuse ANY material from a completed object into another thing, by breaking it down. Better yet, it'll give us the exact same quantity we put in! That's a steal right there. Combine that with 'Artificial Alloys' to reproduce certain materials synthetically, and we're looking to be in some serious business. But why stop there?
 
When it comes to resources, we also need to not be picky. 'Scavenger' from Megaman Zero, 'Salvager', 'Scrapyard Skills', 'upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!!', 'Mauler', 'Acquester', 'Firestorm', and 'Scrapper' allows us to essentially use scrap and salvaged materials to make do with what we have, AND to be able to scour downed ships and locations like the grubby magpie we are. 'Crimson Weapons' can let us harvest the parts from defeated monsters and enemies to likewise make into proper materials as well. Finally, we can use 'Ambrosial Artificer' to reduce the amount of parts needed while improving the ones we DO need!
 
Speaking of monsters, we need to ensure things are okay with them ALONG with other plants. Fortunately, 'Harmless Extraction' lets us take a small piece from a monster and use magic to clone the rest, ensuring we don't need to kill a monster in order to get what we need. The same thing goes with 'Extraction Efficiency', which does the same for plants... when you have super rare or super powerful plants, this is a godsend. Combined with 'Rapid Growth' which can let us replenish the plants afterwards and make them bigger? We are in business for ANY resource we need in a moral standpoint.
 
But do we stop there? Hell no, we need durability. We need to make this shit LAST. 'Armsthrift' heavily decreases our upkeep with weapons, while 'Reliable Invention' and 'Panzerkampf' makes sure our equipment NEVER explodes or malfunctions on us on accident. That kind of reliability, that's golden. 'Robust Engineering' and 'Built To Last' will also ensure our materials LAST... like, 'thousands of years' last. We don't know how long we're going to live, so making sure this shit could survive in a place like Transformers or 40k will go a long way to making it last everywhere else. Finally, 'Repair Savvy' and 'Super Scientific Solution' cuts down our repair and maintenance time by a significant amount to begin with. The less time that's in the shop, the more time is out in the field!
 
Speaking of maintenance. We got the tech side down... but what about magic? We love magic, and so our tech should love magic too:
 
-Setup Wizard (Harry Potter)
-Doll Maker of Bucuresti (Touhou)
-Magitech (Banjo-Kazooie)
-Magitech (Thundercats)
-Technosorcery (Gargoyles)
-Moon Tech (Okami)
-Digitized Sorcery (Fate/Extra)
-Crystal Mechanics (Final Fantasy Type-0)
-Arcane Interface (Storm Hawks)
-The Magic of Science (The Witcher)
-Device Meister (Lyrical Nanoha)
-Manadrives/Antimatter Manipulation Principle (Final Fantasy 13)
-Antimatter Temporal Principle (Final Fantasy 13-2)
-Crimson Saint (Maoyuu Hero and Demon King)
-Mechanist/Magitek Mastery (Final Fantasy VI)
-Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Magitek/The Legionsx5/Garland Ironworks buff (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Ruins of the Last Age/Mythology/Azys Lla data (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Mega Bomb/Guru (Chrono Trigger)
-Tech Wizard (Devil Survivor)
-Technomage (Libriomancer)
-Technomancy (Mage: The Awakening)
 
'Moon Tech' from Okami is more or less modular magitech. It does crazy shit, it runs on mana... seems like something we're going to want to use! Next we have the Manadrives from FF13... yeah, those things. The stuff we can program spells on, comes with a bunch of things. If it can successfully copy and synthesize magic, that means it's pretty familiar with the stuff. We're throwing it in. THEN we have the 'Doll Maker of Bucuresti' from Touhou, which states "Your connection with both practical technology along with magic allows for you to eventually unlock the secrets to creating magitech if given enough time to experiment", so that's kind of a no brainer!
 
We can buff it, too. 'Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th' along with 'Magitek', five ranks of 'The Legions', and a bit of help from 'Garland Ironworks' can ensure whatever magitech we make will be so ridiculously buffed up that it is SICK. Like, it's going to be crazy. Then we have 'Ruins of the Last Age', 'Mythology', and the data from 'Azys Lla'. This means we have a good understanding of Allagan technology, which... was more or less Magitech on crack. Since we know a bunch of this stuff, it means we're in ridiculous business.
 
But what about converting stuff we have? Well that's covered as well. 'Tech Wizard' from Devil Survivor, 'Technomage' from Harry Potter and Libriomancer, and 'Magitech' from Thundercats AND Banjo-Kazooie should give us enough overlap to make sure that whatever we convert, it won't be hampered by magic whatsoever... but just in case let's throw in 'Technosorcery' from Gargoyles and 'Device Meister' from Lyrical Nanoha to pad this out. We really, really cannot overdo the requirements of making everything Magitech for the sake of ensuring that nothing gets flipped up or altered beyond our demanded parameters, which should always be AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE. Speaking of, 'Mega Bomb' not only lets us mix magic seamlessly into our technology, but 'Guru' lets us study and delve into magic as though we were an engineer applying science... no points for guessing what we can do there. We can also seamlessly blend magic and technology even further with 'Technomancy' to truly blur the lines into something we need.
 
And then there's 'Crimson Saint' combined with 'Sufficiently Analyzed Magic' and 'Digitized Sorcery'. Oooooooh, sweet dear. The ability to study magic to such an EXTENT that you can convert it to technology similar to mana-drives or install para-magic into tech? INVALUABLE. Even better, the means to convert technology to magic, making it go BOTH WAYS. Even better, the 'Crystal Mechanics' perk HELPS with tech to magic. This relationship that we have successfully bridged will allow us to tweak, modify, and improve this until the magic and the technology are one in the same. And since we have 'Magitek Mastery' from Final Fantasy VI, we can likewise further convert and improve the technology with magic to make it even better. Finally, 'Arcane Interface' further improves the magitech functions by using magic to control technology, or vice versa.
 
But alas, we cannot stop there. We must move to the logical conclusion. The art of transmutation and alchemy:
 
-Simple/Advanced/Alkahestry/Truth (Full Metal Alchemist)
-Alchemy (Gothic)
-Alchemy (Castlevania)
-Alchemy/Mixing Mixtures (Banjo-Kazooie)
-Alchemy (Samurai Jack)
-Alchemy (Valkyrie Profile)
-Alchemy (World of Warcraft)
-Alchemy (Masters of Magic)
-Alchemy Knowledge (Golden Sun)
-Alchemy (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning)
-Alchemist (Farscape)
-Alchemist (Overlord: Light Novel)
-Alchemist (The Mighty Boosh)
-Equivalent Exchange (Minecraft)
-Alchemist/Formula Formulator (Secrets of Evermore)
-Deranged Alchemist (Van Helsing)
-Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation (Journey to the West)
-Transmutation/Alchemy (Fate/)
-Creation Prodigy (Ar Tonelico)
-Synthesis: Rank 3/Efficiency: Rank 1 (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Alchemization (SBURB)
-Alchemical Expertise (eXceed)
-Master Synthesist (Kingdom Hearts)
 
We have to gain as much alchemical knowledge as possible to make full use of this workshop. EVERYTHING from Full Metal Alchemist goes in, and adding things like 'Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation' and 'Master Synthesist' only further increases what we can turn shit into. 'Alchemy' from so many different places, along with 'Deranged Alchemist' from Van Helsing and 'Alchemy Knowledge' from Golden Sun not only lets us further transmute matter but it also allows us to create potions and methods to reinforce the body! Speaking of reinforcement and enhancement, 'Synthesis' at our rank lets us not only increase the effects of the item but it also adds on a small additional effect to help! Even lets us improve an item quality the more we make it, up to twice the amount! Better yet, 'Efficiency' lets us reduce waste along with increasing effects and quality slightly if we take our time with it. Say, if it can reinforce MAGITECH that would be just keen! Even better, we'll be synthesizing a lot of our things together thanks to 'Alchemization' helping us find a multitude of different combinations too!
 
'Equivalent Exchange' and 'Transmutation/Alchemy' will further increase our knowledge and what we can do, especially if you bought the material from Minecraft to work it to its fullest... and since Fate-style magic is total bullshit, it will only increase what we can do in time. And wouldn't you know it, 'Creation Prodigy' is also a form of transmutation and alchemy! We want to work as much as we can, as hard as we can. To tinker with the composition of the materials, to ensure our equipment is grand in function and form. Everything down to the molecular state must be taken into account, which is why we're also adding 'Mixing Mixtures'... which lets us mix our alchemical potions together without any risk of conflicting problems. 'Alchemical Expertise' is even more bullshit though... if we find out everything ever about an object, no concerns or questions and able to explain everything... we could start taking traits from it and start imbuing other things with those traits! That is absurdly useful. Very useful.
 
 
So there we have it. The means to create, to modify, and to improve. It is ill to go along this journey without the means to create, without being able to prove we have learned and improved. This is no mere journey of exploration, no. It is to show we can rebuild and craft, that we can be exactly like the romanticized ideals we have aspired to be... equipment and all. Every warrior has their sword, every archer has their bow, every knight has their armor. If we are to fill the role, should we not have the means to fill every part of it? Even then, as technology moves forward we must be ready to move with it.
 
Let's make some cool shit.
