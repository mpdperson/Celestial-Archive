For most purposes it uses a transmitted accelerator mass spectrometer to create a \u201csnapshot\u201d of an objects components, atomic weight, and radioactivity, allowing for in-depth analysis. For biological materials, the system switches to an electrospray ionization system, so that plants or animals can be scanned without causing radiation damage. For a Jumper, you no longer need to have an AI linked to the system for it to work, though that would help. You can also take DNA scans of organisms for further study, and scan devices to help you figure out what they do, and maybe later reproduce them. Lastly, if you have a longer ranged sensor system, you could link the Scanner to that to scan further away, even if being in the Scanner's original range would get you clearer results."

Trick Weapons are weapons with a variety of special abilities relating to their form. The most common type of Trick Weapons are those that can transform in some manner. An example being swords that can lock into specialized sheaths in order to become different weapons, sometimes radically so. Not to say transformation is the only ability, there are also melee weapons with guns attached, and maces that can be charged with unnatural blue electricity to deal massive damage. Hunter's Tools are pieces of equipment with special abilities activated by using Blood Bullets or Quicksilver Bullets as a medium. Hunter's Tools are usually supernatural items that have been made to work using a Blood/Quicksilver Bullet medium, such as the Beast Roar, a beast's claw that when activated, allows the wielder to roar like a beast. Some Hunter's Tools are completely manmade as well, though this is a relative minority. Basically, you now know how to convert things into being activated and powered by Blood Bullets and Quicksilver Bullets. Doing so allows anyone to use them, even if they are completely mundane beings, so long as they have the bullets mentioned above on their person.

Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own. By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source. From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers. Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully. There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in."

A machine that generates a static field to generate an electric shock attack is the same as a lightning bolt spell. With this perk, you can comprehend the link that exists between Science and Magic, and with the proper time and resources reproduce a piece of technology as a magical spell or reproduce a magical effect as a piece of technology. For example, you could take a lightbulb, analyze it, understand how it works in its  entirety, then create a magical spell that produces the same amount of light when an equivalent amount of magical power is fed into it. There are a few caveats here, however. First, you must be capable of already replicating the magical effect, spell, or piece of technology on your own, as this power only lets you reproduce a magical or technological effect in its  equivalent technological or magical form. If you weren't able to reproduce a magical effect using magic or a technological effect using technology in the first place, this perk will not let you reproduce them in the opposite manner now. Comprehension alone won't cut it, the ability to already reproduce the effects is necessary. Second, complexity of the magic or technology you wish to reproduce a converted equivalent of is conserved across systems, so the amount of time necessary to reproduce the equivalent in the opposing system will be, at minimum, the same amount of time it would take to reproduce the equivalent in the same system. A highly sophisticated though reproducible multi-layered magic construct or spell will result in an equally complex technological creation that will be equally or more difficult to understand, use, and replicate. Third, the limitations of the magic or technology are carried over. If you were incapable of using a piece of tech or magic, you will be incapable of using its equivalent. A spell that creates an Elemental without true sentience will not create a thinking, self-upgrading AI in its technological equivalent, though reproducing an AI as a magic construct or a self-aware thinking magical construct as a technological entity WILL. If a magical entity or technological construct has a soul, so would its equivalent, but you would already have to be capable of reproducing said soul in the original system. And fourth, converted technology or magic that you give to others will function only if both A:Either you or them (Doesn't have to be both) would be capable of using the original magic or technology, and B: That if a piece of magic or tech requires energy to function, then an appropriate amount of energy is provided to fuel the magic or tech. Draw off a battery or mana capacitor, have it draw off the person's own mana reserves if they have them, have it draw off ambient energy in the air. One way or another, an amount of energy equivalent to the original power requirements must be supplied"

		"Description": "Synthesis [400CP]\n Synthesis is the most basic art of the alchemist and deals with the creation of items, usually through simple mixing, though sometimes synthesis can be a complex sequence of magical and chemical reactions. All alchemists learn this to some degree. Seeing as you're an alchemist, the synthesis of items should really be second nature to you. That being said, even if you're already an expert, there's nothing saying that you don'thave room to improve further. Also there is no reason why we can't help you improve, if you're willing to put in the effort to learn. !!!Not sure if the ranks stack but I'm saying they do!!! Rank 0: The basics of synthesis, learning how to make basic potions and food without proper ingredients is still pretty helpful. Sure, you won't be making anything high quality anytime soon, but at least you can make something safely edible from refuse material. It still won't be \u201cgood\u201d for you, but it won't kill you. Rank 1: Don't like the looks of what you've made? No matter, just give it a makeover! You can substitute the appearance of what you've made with something else similar to it in nature. Of course, appearances are exactly that, so don't expect the function of your item to change. Rank 2: Enhancing what is already present, the items that you create will often possess some small trait related to its original function, generally acting as a sort of minor boost. The nature of the trait will never go against the intended purpose of the item \u2013apotion that normally heals health may also help recover a small bit of your magic. Rank 3: Practice makes perfect, and you're still a long ways away from perfect. Each time you make that same item, the quality of the product increases, resulting in increased magnitude of the intended effects. Though the gains will diminish the more you create a single item, you'll find that by the time you reach the plateau you'll have nearly twice the original effect."

		"Description": "Efficiency [600CP] \nAs you grow in your skills as a crafter, you'll start to see more and more requests being handed your way. Before long, you're going to realize that you don't have all the time in the world to make everything that is requested of you, and that's when it becomes all the more important to complete your assignments efficiently. Efficiency isn't just a matter of time management \u2013it's about managing waste, reducing redundancies, and above all \u2013improving yourself. Yes, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of wasteful choices you have to make \u2013but should you apply yourself to this, there's a lot more to efficiency than what you'll learn by scratching the surface. All it depends on is whether you're disciplined enough to follow through. Rank 0: As advertised, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of waste produced during your crafting process. Achieving a 1:1 conversion will not be possible with this alone, but being able to turn the waste product into a desired product can go a long ways to making synthesis more manageable. Rank 1: You can use less of an item, you won't need to make as much. The effect of any item that you craft is increased slightly from its original magnitude, and their durations are again increased slightly. It will take you a little longer than usual to create items \u2013but that's an acceptable sacrifice."
