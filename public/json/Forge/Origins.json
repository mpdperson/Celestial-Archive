        "Description": "Every living thing, even a standard human of this world, runs by some basic rules that the human you probably began your journey as didn’t. In the words of Geralt of Rivia, “Everything in this world eats well”. First, even mundane people are very strong, enough to carry a torso-sized iron hammer or a portable cannon as long and as wide as you - though such large implements will still be rather unwieldy and bulky for you to carry, and you’d need training to effectively use them as well. You can’t really use this strength for running or jumping significantly better than what a real-life human could do, however - your power is far more concentrated in the upper body than the legs. As a monster, you’re capable of breaking solid boulders half your size with a few good hits, though the quarry of this world will probably be more resistant to your attacks than such environmental features. Creatures are also tougher in general, particularly resistant to significant injury from falling and getting their body bent in strange ways. This is because bone density and the tensile strength of living tissues are both very high, also making it hard to lose limbs aside from the tips of tails or keratinous growths like horns. As such, things that cause one to really bleed are rare. Brute impact seems to be the measuring stick of vitality in this world as things tend to get hit until they fall over, unconscious or dead. As a humanoid, your stamina is boosted greatly to the point where jogging for minutes in full armor, swinging your man-sized weapons, and firing bullets the size of grapefruits will cause barely any fatigue or soreness to build up. You can exert yourself for hours before starting to lose focus and energy. As a monster, you’ll tire out after a few minutes of pitched combat, but you’ll also have an enraged state after taking enough punishment that completely nullifies the effects of your fatigue, and you can replenish stamina by taking a moment to catch your breath - but leaving yourself open. Basically: you’re strong, you’re tough, and you have very deep stamina reserves.",
