Although called a bracelet, there are different forms for different races. Slime people might be injected with a nanite swarm programmed with the same effect, for example. Once you have equipped the bracelet, the AI will adapt itself to gain an ideal personality fitting your own. The AI of a loner might become their perfect friend, that of a rich girl always left alone might become a butler caring for her, and someone living a loveless life might find that their companion AI has all the qualities they'd want in their girlfriend.No matter how your companion AI will end up, they will always end up in your best interest. As they have a photographic memory and see the world through your senses, they can highlight important objects or places you might have missed, jog your memory if you forget something important, or browse through the internet to find information a million times faster than somebody with a human brain would.There are also various upgrades that can add to the functionality of the companion bracelet, such as identifying software allowing your companion AI to scan the Aura of creatures or objects to determine their ability, level, and other information, or even an upgrade to allow an instance of them to live in your brain and tap into your senses to control your body in dangerous situations, or just show the trajectories enemy projectiles will take so you can easily dodge them. For 50 CP each, you can apply one upgrade to your companion bracelet, with no limit on how many you can purchase.",

        "Description": "Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Avatars, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. \n The Arcana of Avatars first lets you craft, and then manifest, an Avatar. Crafting an Avatar starts modestly expensive in Arcane, and eventually becomes very expensive, though you only need to craft a given Avatar once. Manifesting it costs the same amount, and maintaining it ties up a petty amount of mind and intellect to start, growing to a modest amount for the greatest Avatars. \n Withdrawing the invested intelligence causes an Avatar to dissipate, but by paying the Arcane cost again it may be resummoned. The range that the Arcana of Avatars may summon at is normally dependent on your Arcane State, but by buying this perk you gain the maximum range - able to summon an avatar even into another plane of existence, though you need at least some way of targeting where you want it to manifest, of which you know several methods. Normally, it's only possible to manifest a single avatar at a time. \n Most avatars are constructs, though Greater and True Avatars are living creatures. Avatars are immune to mind affecting spells. You can look through your Avatar's eyes at any time. Your avatar is completely loyal and incorruptible by any force, magical or mundane. It will work towards your goals even if it doesn't know it's an avatar or that you exist. \n You may take control of your avatar at any time, and while doing so may channel your abilities through it - casting spells, manifesting powers, and so on. Likewise you can use your skills and feats through it. The avatar may be aware of this control or explain it away as you like. You may give them orders they will follow to the best of their abilities. \n There are several different stages of avatar that you can learn to manifest sequentially. \n Rudimentary: Has no mind of its own, is very fragile, cannot channel your powers, can't speak, and can't pass for a living thing. Will be destroyed by even a light blow. You must actively control it, or it will collapse to the ground. Lesser Has the mind of a dumb child but can follow orders, but won't do anything you didn't explicitly order. Can't yet channel your powers. Might survive a single light blow. Cannot speak. Can pass as a living thing at a distance, but is cold and doesn't breath. \n Standard: Has the mind of a slow adult. Can speak, but only in your voice. It cannot attack on its own, but it is able to be a channel for your powers and skills at this point. Its flesh is warm and it breathes, though it won't sweat or bleed. \n Superior: Has the mind of an average adult and can think independently as needed. It has the health of an average human. It can contact you to get further instructions if it needs them. It can use basic skills on its own. \n Greater: Is actually a living thing a first level character with skills and feats and the attributes of a starting adventurer, though it will never learn or grow. If you don't want it to, it won't even know it's an avatar, believing itself a real person, following your goals subconsciously. \n True: Nothing can detect that a True avatar is anything but a normal mortal. It can fall in love, have children, learn and grow, though it can't grow beyond a fourth of your own fully realized potential. Though it can be better than you at things by specializing differently. \n Once you grow able to manifest a True avatar, you'll start the cycle again with a second avatar, starting at Rudimentary and growing to True, at which point the cycle will repeat.",

Once you have manifested a True Avatar you will be able to separate a piece of your soul - the part that's able to manifest that Avatar, and imbue it with vast quantities of Arcane, raising that Avatar to the status of Sub-Soul. \n You lose the ability to manifest one Avatar, but in return the Sub-Soul becomes a persistent being you don't need to maintain. If it should ever be slain, it will return in a night and a day for no cost. Its potential grows, being able to become as strong as you. This is just potential, it will have to get there the hard way. \n If you let it, it can channel your powers itself - casting your memorized spells, manifesting powers from your reserves, and so on. It also counts as a Bound Phylactery. So long as it lives, you will return. You can channel spells through it as if you were present, without having to take control of it or use its actions, and observe around it, rather then just through its eyes. You always count as touching it for the purposes of spells (and it counts as “you” for purposes for self-only spells), and can flawlessly teleport to it over any distance by the spell, or for a small cost in Arcane. You can store Arcane in it, and both you and it can draw upon that Arcane to use Arcana itself. You can hang up to six spells in it for both of your uses, and hang another six spells as contingencies. If those contingencies are attack spells, they won't harm your Sub-Soul even if they drop down on top of it. \n It retains the incorruptibility and absolute loyalty of an Avatar, and counts as a living creature or as a construct, whichever is most advantageous at any given moment.",

Centuries of data and teachings on these subjects, enough to bring even a complete amateur to the level of a master with enough time spent. The doll is an exceptional teacher, able to teach in both theoretical and practical terms to any of her students. Oddly enough, the doll prefers to wear glasses while teaching too. In future worlds, similar information can be found in the doll's database on local martial and ninja techniques, excluding unique or particularly hard to find information.",

        "Description": "To be a Wuxian is to respect the concept of a Legacy, something that is handed down across the generations, gaining something with each new possessor. To be a Forger of Legacies is to be one who can craft such things, handing them down to others in the expectation that they will grow as they are used, then be handed down again, and again, and again. A Legacy can take any shape, such a sword, a staff, a cloak, or even a title. When a Legacy is made, the Forger instills in it one singular effect, attack, or technique at its most basic level, then passes it off to a Bearer. As long as the Bearer possesses the Legacy, they can use that ability, and that ability will grow and grow with usage and insight. Eventually, it will reach a point where it can grow no further (level 100 as Jee Han would say), and the Legacy should be passed on to another person. In doing so, the Old Bearer can either choose to instill a second ability (another effect, attack, or technique) into the Legacy, or to evolve the first ability. Unless the Legacy is specifically passed upwards, or there are no descendants, previous Bearers will be unable to use the Legacy. Each Legacy is typically dedicated to a unifying concept, such as a family, a nation, or an ideal. \n Should keep. Lets you give magical artifacts to organizations, capable of being adapted to new circumstances even after you have left.\n&emsp;• Not useful for short term, but still a unique crafting ability, suited for its purpose",

Through metaphysical means, this chip has now fully merged with your soul and became one with your being. These are two of its primary functions: Data Storage and Analysis. \n The A.I. Chip stores everything you experience through your senses and records it down, analyzing data, gathering samples, importing and organizing your memory, running any types of simulations based on that data. \n For example, using data from a target, the A.I. chip can simulate a path to victory against that enemy, the greater the data the easier it would be one example of a potential result would be fighting an opponent without taking any damage as well as analysing the probability of injury occurring. Estimate wind, trajectory and analysing orbital shooting, and A.R.(Augmented Reality) assist giving a nigh-100% chance to hit the target. \n With this chip Leylin was able to create potions as a master when he was just an Acolyte, optimise an ancient knight breathing technique, refine the bloodline of a Giant Kemoyin Serpent from it's descendents, a very pure bloodline equal to that of a first generation warlock, analyze different layers of the Weave allowing him to gain all spell models of each layer. \n The Chip can also scan, analyze and create spell models that would take others months in days and transfer it straight into your memory, simulating creation of your own spell models based on data analyzed. \n Scanning you and others and you will get the statistics such as Strength, Agility, Vitality, Spiritual Force, Magical Power, Current Status, Skills, Elements Affinity, Feats, Specialties. This is only an example, you can freely change how your stats are categorized, and what the number represents. If you have access to Mana, Qi, Ki, Chi, Aura, Psionic, Esoteric Energies and such, the A.I. Chip will recognize and establish records about it and for others in future worlds. \n The A.I. Chip is also able warn you against danger,when your stats changed, undesired status afflictions, act as a firewall for your mind, perform surgery on your body, expel poisons, formulate cures for curses, improve recipes, control your energies, detect energy undulations, assist in breakthroughs, can connect to and interact with both magical and scientific technology, get rid of abnormal status, scan down to the sub-atomic level and observe antimatter, controlling your clones, etc. \n The A.I. Chip's capabilities improve as you and your soul grow stronger, those mentioned here are just PART of what the chip is capable of. \n Your chip starts out with the processing power of 10 supercomputers, enough to turn 10 years of research into 2 hours. It comes with a maximum scanning range of 10km. Both the A.I. Chip and its scanning ability is undetectable by any means, though it has a difficulty scanning those immensely stronger than you, and some are even able to prevent you from scanning them. \n You automatically know how to use your A.I. Chip to the best of its abilities. While a regular chip can store 10,000 years worth of memories, yours has infinite memory storage and as the A.I. Chip is bonded to your soul, everything in its memory is directly accessible to you wherever you desire it to be. Include basic scientific knowledge of Leylin's old world. \n For an extra 200 CP, your A.I. Chip is upgraded to gain all the same features at the same level of power Leylin's was at at the end of the novel, to the point that it could simulate and analyse universes and Daos of reality, and know everything there is in this verse. You still can upgrade it with the ease of a regular one, just not as much gain until you reach Rank 9/Overgod level. \n The A.I. Chip does not have any intelligence of its own, but you can import an already existing A.I. into the chip.",

Training too much till you break half your muscles will still put you in the hospital, but what would be a lifelong crippling for others would only be a temporary thing for you, and you'd still benefit fully. You can use and develop mutually exclusive or opposite powers without any harm, and similarly use any and all powers you have without fear of ruining your own body or mind or whatever. No amount of overusing your powers can hurt you or them permanently. Again, you might suffer for a while, but it'll only ever be temporary and they'd grow that much stronger for it.",

Built of nanomaterials, they can change their shape and structure when needed, though they seem to prefer the shapes of WWII-era ships. For example, their turrets instead of holding normal cannons instead house photon cannons, or their hulls open to fire their super graviton cannons. Ships made of nanomaterials must be controlled by a Union Core, or similarly advanced computer system. If purchased by a human, or as a second ship by Mental Models, these vessels are run by a Union Core (free) which does not currently have a Mental Model. \n This one seems different from the other kinds of Fog ships, focused more on supply, repair, ability to modify ships and manufacturing of ammo and nanomaterials for use.

Congratulations, you are the proud owner-belonging-partner of an ancient, obsolete, outdated thing stored in the basement of a Time Lord Museum. \n Well, that and one of the two most advanced ships in existence, once all the other versions get locked up behind a Time Lock. This is a TARDIS, Time and Relative Dimensions In Space. It's the most advanced piece of Space/Time technology ever created, and it... maybe he/her, who knows, is all yours! This is a completely sapient, fifteen-dimensional ship that can range anywhere from the size of a small briefcase to Jupiter on the outside, while remaining a constant size on the inside. And that constant size is “infinite”. Yup. \n There is no limit to how large it can get on the inside, how many rooms, corridors, libraries or pools it can have. It's capable of massive, ridiculous manipulations of time and space, the simplest, of course, being moving through it willy-nilly. Seriously, sky's the limit here. You can go anywhen between the Big Bang and the heat death of the universe, and anywhere in or outside the universe you have coordinates for. That's mostly what it does on the outside. \n On the inside it can do anything and everything you can imagine regarding Time and Space. It also has fabricators capable of producing virtually anything, an instance of the Eye of Harmony powering it, massive libraries, fully functional Chameleon and Translation circuits, a state of temporal grace that prohibits weapons from being fired inside without your permission, and all the other bells and whistles you've ever seen in the other Type 40 you know about. And unlike that one, this one is in perfect working order. Honestly, who steals their new ride from a repair shop? \n Just about everything about this ship can change for the sake of utility and to be pleasing to you... and itself, of course. It retains all improvements, recovers flawlessly from any damage done to it in less than a second, and won't blow up the universe if the impossible happens and it gets destroyed. \n Also, no matter how often or with what you try and look into the Time Vortex it's simply not going to work until after you've gotten your Spark.

Also contained within are vast planet sized biomes filled with seemingly endless zoos of alien creatures. The ship is easy to control, being linked to your mind, and cloaking it from all manners of detection is as simple as commanding it to be so. It can even prevent its own gravitational pull from activating, in case you wanted to part it next to Earth.

It also acts as a key-none of the other parts of this system will operate without it. Next is the AGE Builder, which is an extremely fast 3-D printer (able to make a Mobile Suit rifle in seconds) and continuously collects data from the AGE Device and AGE System. The AGE System is a data collection program that can be installed onto a Mobile Suit and acts as a unique OS. It will collect data and evolve along with its pilot, researching “solutions” to problems, coming in the form of the Wear Parts, arm and legs designed to improve and counter situations. The Wear Parts are flown to the AGE Gundams in battle using the AMEMBO (one of which is included with this purchase) and swapped mid-battle, though with a different design you could remove the AMEMBO from the equation entirely. This is a highly advanced system, one that can collect, analyze, improve, build and conquer many situations. A Mobile Suit equipped with the AGE System will have a bright letter on its front, defaulting to a blue “A”-as a bonus, you may change the coloring and the letter to whatever you wish at any time.",

Much like the name might imply, this field allows you to lift objects; smaller objects hover about a foot in front of your palm, whereas larger objects, most of which must be specifically modified to work with it and are typically on tracks or rails, move as close to you as they are able. You can manipulate these objects with your hand, and even throw them with a surprising amount of force, enough to penetrate a body with a bone spike and nail it to a steel wall. Stasis, on the other hand, as its name might imply, creates a temporal stasis field of a certain volume around the targeted object. It affects both organic and inorganic material, including living creatures, and has no problem with irregularly-shaped objects, flowing out around the targeted object.\n&emsp;• Allows for the movement of objects remotely as well as freeze them in place while working on them.",

Each a perfect instrument to tattoo the body, these needles provide a potent tool for the use of body decorations. Making even the most elegant and complex patterns and designs easy to apply for the one who uses these, as they innately correct even the slightest mistake their user makes. Moreover, their use will never cause infection or injury, and the surface of the tattoo will seal over nearly instantly after it is applied. \n Along with the needles themselves, you will also receive a supply of many different mundane inks of exceptional quality. Though of course the needles can also be used with various other inks you might be able to acquire. They can handle anything, from the mundane ones to sorcerous inks to tattoo occult sigils, to chalcanth used to create living demon-ink tattoos, to stranger substances still, and even the moonsilver ink used to create the Moonsilver Tattoos and various tattoo artifacts. That last one in particular resonates with the Silver Needles, for when they are used with moonsilver ink, they may cause the Moonsilver Tattoos to become temporarily fluid and accept new tattoo artifacts to be inscribed upon the skin of their wearer.\n&emsp;• For mundane and magic tattoo crafting at any level",

It also comes with a sales clerk and an alchemist of exceptional talent if still within reasonable limits (read: not Realm of Heroes or Level One Hundred) whom will produce and sell potions for you. You get potions for free, and get a cut of all profits the store makes. The laboratory, sales clerk, and alchemist will follow you jump to jump, although the clerk and alchemist aren't the same people jump-to-jump (unless you purchase the Guild Base option, in which case they can be if they are part of the Guild Base).

An Arcane Lich can strip a Dragon of its breath, a Beholder of its gaze, and a Sorcerer of their spells. Such work are the products of specialized Arcana, formal techniques some Liches learn. The converse is not true. An Anti-Magic field does nothing to something fueled with Arcane, while an Arcane Null-Magic Field shuts down mortal magic. An Arcane Item won't show up to Detect Magic, won't be damaged by Disjunction, and generally speaking ignores all such forces. \n In future jumps, it's safe to treat Arcane as a “higher” force, except when it runs against other explicitly “higher” reality rewriting forces, such as the Power Cosmic of Marvel or Flame Imperishable of LotR. It can affect the “lesser forces”, and they cannot affect it.

This can't be used to steal it from another being or to grant the ability to hold or use Arcane to people that cannot already do so. As its own regeneration rate is trivial, storing Arcane energy in prepared crystal and gemstone receptacles ahead of time is the normal method of getting it.\n&emsp;• Your creative mental energies lets you slowly dream more of it into being. Mechanically your regeneration rate is tied to your Intelligence.\n&emsp;• You can see Arcane Script, a magical language written in Arcane energies. It has some use in magical items. If you know the script (which you do), you can also write it, though that costs energy. It's possible to drain the Arcane energy used to write the script, erasing what was written.\n&emsp;• They can develop Arcana, special disciplines fueled by their Arcane energies. Arcane naturally recovers at a snail's pace for all but the most intelligent. More evolved liches gain bonuses to its recovery.

Almost none of these wondrous factory-cathedrals endure today, and those that remain are terribly damaged or lost to the impassable wilderness. But while practically no one alive could build a factory-cathedral today, the Deathlords are some of the few beings that could. Still, only one amongst the deathlords is officially known to possess an equivalent... \n And now, you may acquire one of these wonders of dark design. Built as a great tower, this imposing manse has been designed to serve both as a factory-cathedral reminiscent of those built in the First Age and as an equally effective necrosurgery laboratory using more recent designs pioneered by the Deathlords. Unlike the hallowed cathedrals built by the Solars of old, these halls have not been sanctified or constructed as a temple-manse. Instead, special precautions have been taken to ensure the cold, sterile perfection of the Abyssal Essence that powers the horrible machines within. \n Within these workshops, long forgotten First Age tools are set side by side with just as sophisticated new innovations. Here, eldritch suspension vats preserve the dead. Essence-fueled welding tools fuse bone to bone. Flasks of reagents bubble and strange devices whir, spark and glow. The place carries about it a dark majesty that scares away most natural animals and invites bad weather, yet the environment stays oddly dry and cool. Black ornaments inset with iron, onyx, and obsidian further channel the manse's Essence into necromantic power, such that the costs of necromantic spells cast within the manse's walls are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the manse bolsters the strength of such spells beyond the capabilities of the necromancer's own Essence. All the better to animated the necrotic warmachines one might create within.",

A place that has contained a dying neutron star, it was known for creating some of the most powerful weapons to exist in all of the Nine Realms. Forges were heated eternally from the heat of this star, strong enough to kill even the greatest of Asgardians were it not for one of the weapons forged in this very place. The mythical Uru springs from this place, metal that is used in the weapons of the gods. Such a place would cause untold prosperity or ruin depending on who held this place. Mayhaps the dwarves who controlled such a place realized the dangers of only having one, so there is a second structure that has been hidden away in the event Nidavellir was attacked. Maybe call it Myrkheim? Regardless, the heart of a dying star is yours to use in these mythical forges. Great works shall be created in these halls. Terrible, but great. Just don't get in the way of the focusing lens. It could kill you.",

With no interference, they will soon rediscover it and slowly begin gaining access to the variety of rooms it houses. But due to a wrinkle in time, space, or perhaps simply in response to your own special nature, a copy of that magical space seems to have sprung into existence. Not a perfect copy with bound elementals and a Tapestry of Time, mind, but similar enough to service as a fine base in the space between worlds. The Second Sanctuary can be accessed through a small magical emerald in the shape of a pyramid. Tapping it will teleport you directly to the dining hall. Tapping it once inside will teleport you back to exactly where you were when you came in. \n The Second Sanctuary will be surrounded on all sides by empty space, with stars sprinkling the blackness off in the far distance. This is merely an illusion as the rooms occupy a pocket dimension and are not actually situated in outer space. If you desire, you can set the view to that of appearing to float amidst a certain solar system you have already encountered. It contains two plush bedrooms, each with a queen-sized four-post bed, desk, a chair, several chests, and a wardrobe, everything crafted from wood and comfortable red fabrics. In addition there is a small dining hall set off to one side in the midst of a well-tended garden. The table will feed anyone who sits down at it with simple, but filling, food and drink. \n The Second Sanctuary also comes equipped with a large, but currently empty, library and a workshop that includes a classic forge, tools and all. Don't be surprised to if you find a tall Elf wandering the library or relaxing at the feasting table. He dresses as loudly as a rainbow on several kinds of narcotics and is a little too friendly when it comes to invading personal space, but he's worth listening to. When he does stop by, his pockets, packs, and spaceship (How do you think he got here? Flapping his arms?) will be simply packed to the gills with magical weapons, enchanted armor, mysterious trinkets, and mystic essences brought with him from Rivellon proper. His stock tends to very wildly with each visit, but he'll usually have at least a few eye-catching artifacts. Who know what he might find in his travels through the multiverse? You might be surprised just what he can get his fingers on. Just don't expect him to sell anything for less than it's truly worth. He's too cunning for that. And yes, his name is Jack.

An Enchanter's Forge is actually a chaotic collection of magics and Mist in a small pocket dimension that will bind itself to an individual that claims it. The power held within this collection of magics is potent and may be worked as if it were a material substance, though it must be anchored to a physical medium to be of actual use, effectively tying the resulting magics to an object. This creates an enchantment that can potentially carry a wide variety of effects. \n Working the magic within an Enchanter's Forge is exceptionally difficult, requiring a lifetime of work to master the process and gain the potential to create truly powerful enchantments. Until then, you can only really give minor ones such as an enchantment for a blade to drink in blood to repair itself or creating a bow that produces its own arrows. Actually making enchantments with the Enchanter's Forge takes a great deal of time, requiring a heavy investment in time to actually create any powerful enchantments. Even then, you must experiment and practice with it to garner any results, no two Enchanter's Forges are the same, meaning you cannot rely on the experiences of others to guide your own use. The power within an Enchanter's Forge never seems to run out, and it is a great source of magical power if you possess some other way to utilize it",

        "Description": "Well these little buggers are the cause of a lot of the trouble going down on Earth, but their ability to effect evolution is definitely beyond debate. There are several different types of Crystal, and each purchase of this let's you choose one type. You'll start this Jump with your purchased crystals floating a bit right next to you, and you'll get another once a year. In Jump this will mean finding them, while afterwards they'll be added to your warehouse. Note that you can still find these in jump normally, but this will ensure a regular supply. \n Blue Crystal: About as simple as it gets, this little bugger acts as a gatherer and battery for evolutionary potential. Eating it will result in gaining a very large chunk of EVO, enough to fuel a series of large changes for you. \n Green Crystal: This crystal analyzes the path evolution has taken, and when ingested will allow you at a time of your choosing to change back to a form in your Record of Evolution, a transformation which may last for up to a month. This doesn't have to be used right away, you can eat it and bank the use until a time of your choosing, and at any one time you can store roughly three such uses. \n Red Crystal: Probably best described as evolutionary steroids, and the most blatant of the crystals, this one takes in evolutionary data and uses it to create a new and extremely potent evolutionary form. When ingested you can change into this form, a transformation that can last up to one month. While temporary, and despite having no control over what said form will be, this does mean that said form will be added to your Record of Evolution, which can prove very useful in conjunction with the Green Crystals or the Review of Evolution perk. \n Yellow Crystal: This crystals gathers and analyzes evolutionary data. Eating it results in a sudden flood of information into your mind that will inform you of all the various useful evolutionary paths you could take, giving an awareness of options you otherwise would have been completely blind to. Alternatively you can let it rest in an environment for a few days and then devour it to gain a sudden influx of data on the local biosphere and living beings.",

Namely, the higher up on the food chain (meaning it processes larger amounts of biological energy) it is, the more you'll gain per pound. You do technically have a cap on how much you can store relative to your form, but it's large enough that at full capacity you could go through a large number of relatively extreme changes before bottoming out.

It's easier to become a large reptilian beast when the dinosaurs roam the earth for example. This only requires intent on your part, with nature handling the rest. Note that evolving leaves you with a new body in it's prime, meaning you should haven't to worry about old age. Evolving only requires several minutes to let the changes take place.

For 50 CP you have ten times as much gold, and you'll find that every month any gold you've spent or expended has been replaced within the pouch. The pouch itself can hold any number of gold coins, but only gold coins, inside of it. \n One notable fact regarding these coins, and indeed Yggdrasil Gold Coins in general, is that they can substitute for many types of incidental materials or reagents when it comes to creating magical items or artifacts. For example as long as you have a scroll to work with the gold could substitute for inks to allow you to make a magic scroll, or special oils or unguents in a bit of clockwork, and so on and so forth. Hell, you can even use the stuff to garnish food and drink at no risk to the consumer.

Paper will not burn on a fire of metallic logs, and would only be heated. If smelted and cast into new form, the metals of Malfeas lose this property. Their means of cultivation also diverge greatly from those found in Creation. Malfean crops rarely require anything so simple as plowing, sowing and reaping. Instead, they might require to be grown from human finger bones planted in the ground, bear fruit only to the beating of drums, or release their harvest only at the sacrifice of a living demon. \n Now I will offer to you a collection of five kinds of seeds.

If they don't have the proper genetic code, then they merely turn to stone before crumbling into pieces. Do be careful.",

Twinkling Titanite is handy for the reinforcement of equipment steeped in strength, baring unique abilities, without diminishing those properties, though it's somewhat poor for crafting. \n Titanite Scales are left behind by Crystal Lizards that grow to immense sizes after devouring souls, and are the ideal material for reinforcing equipment made through Soul Transposition. All three being handy materials for a blacksmith though. Titanite originating from the chest will slowly replenish over time once used for something. Theassorted normal Titanite will replenish one piece every hour or so, while the special varieties usually take a couple days per piece. \n In reality, the chest is a loyal mimic that guards these resources and whatever else you put inside. If need be, it can even reveal itself to fight a would-be thief or carry out simple instructions. When walking about, two long arms and a huge tongue protrude from the inside, teeth grow along the edges of the lid and a long, lanky, deceptively powerful body stretches out of the bottom.",

It forms only from large concentrations of the Seven Prismatic Ores, legendary divine materials that possess qualities far and away above anything else. Why this occurs, or even who first discovered the Caloric Stone, is unknown. \n While held the Caloric Stone grants the usual benefits of a World Item upon its bearer, providing protections against negative status, instant death, being trapped or held, scryed upon, and so forth, trumping even the effects of other World Items. However, while useful, those are far and away the least impressive aspects of the stone. The truth of the matter is quite simple; the Caloric Stone is the ultimate crafting material. No matter what you are making, no matter how mighty, no matter what other materials are included, adding the Caloric Stone will make that item or bit of craftsmanship better. \n Food, drink, weapons, armor, buildings, vehicles, golems, indeed anything that can be crafted can be quantifiably made superior (by an astounding degree) by the inclusion of the Caloric Stone in its creation process, as the stone expands the possibilities and power of what can be done with crafting. If you were to use particularly mighty materials in the creation of something, say ingredients on par with those usually used in the making of a Divine Tier item, the resulting piece of equipment would be truly legendary, halfway between the status of a Divine tier item and a World Item. Obviously, and unfortunately, the stone is expended when used. \n However, since you're paying at a premium, you are guaranteed to receive a new Caloric Stone exactly one month after using it, appearing in whatever location is most convenient for you. You may explicitly hand this to other people but you need not fear losing it. If separated from your person in a fashion you didn't intend it will appear in the closest convenient location for you a day later. However if it was used in this time frame to make something then you must still wait a month for it to respawn. The Caloric Stone is discounted for those that purchased the 600 CP option for Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools. The Caloric Stone is utterly unique, and cannot be duplicated or copied via any method whatsoever using in-jump methods.",

If you need to buy or sell something off the table these are the guys you want to call. If there's some kind of commercially available weapon, gadget, or vehicle of dubious legality you need to get and have its IDs removed, they can do it for pretty reasonable prices. They're not so good at finding super rare or unique items, but just about everything else is fair game. Just as well, if you need something to disappear or be sold, they'll take it off your hands and you will never see it again for a pretty substantial amount of cash. Pretty weirdly loyal for criminal underworld types too... as long as you don't sell them out or give them trouble, they'll be happy to do business with you wherever, whenever.",

To say nothing of the mighty plant-based creatures that spawn from it that will help to defend your guild base, or how you could harvest from it constantly to feed an immense population. \n Or perhaps instead your guild base possesses an entrance to the legendary Agartha, a subterranean city long abandoned but filled with such mineral wealth that it could be mined forever, with an ore vein for every type of metal or precious stone one could imagine no matter how rare that replenish a mere day after excavation. \n If those don't tickle your interest, perhaps you will find the Scholomance to be to your liking? A school of dark and forbidden magic, filled with the knowledge of every spell imaginable, and that allows unparalleled control and manipulation of the weather and empowers the magic of all rightful inhabitants of the Guild Base while they are inside. \n Or maybe none of these things appeal, and you have a different idea in mind? So long as it is not one of The Twenty (ie: expendable 1-time effects), and so long as it remains entirely tied to the Guild Base itself, you may instead come up with your own World Item, with appropriate effects to apply to your base.

Incredibly powerful items made by the Gods and normally only accessible through completing quests might even be priced at billions of gold. But this cost is worth it, as there really is literally anything available: items, hints on how to advance your abilities, skills and abilities themselves in their entirety, NPCs (artificial entities created by the system) of any level, whether you want to lease them or buy them outright, information, or animals and monsters. Even things of questionable usefulness can be found here, such as the sex tapes of the Gods (\"Goddess of Breasts VS. Goddess of Beauty, Beach Edition, Interactive\"), or the abilities to always sense the time of the day and to guess how many hairs there are on a creature. And if you had, say, a decillion gold and sacrificed the population of a planet, you could even buy yourself into Godhood. \n The wares available in the Gold Market will include ones from both worlds you have visited in the past, and worlds you will travel to in the future, so that its slogan of offering truly anything actually holds true for you, though the same price markup still applies. It'll also accept any currency you might have on you, instead of only recognizing the gold coins used in the system.

Dwarven miners know this, and the lure of mithril often proves irresistible. With this, you need not worry about the presence of any Balrog or Orcs, as your veins of mithril shall lie within a mine dropped into a location near to where you start or even just connected to your Warehouse. The great quantities of mithril that these mines make available allow Dwarf-smiths, should you have invited any, to craft marvellously strong and light armor for your warriors or yourself. More than simply a store-room and workshop for Dwarven smiths, a Mithril Armory is capable of outfitting an entire host in the most supple and strong metal known in Middle-earth. The presence of such materials naturally attracts the finest Dwarvensmiths, who may also turn their efforts to forging superior weapons in addition to crafting mithril armor. Armored and armed in shining mithril and dwarf-make weapons, your forces are certain to be fearsome indeed on the battlefield. In future jumps, you will attract whatever setting equivalent to the Dwarves there happens to be. To find work in your armory and lands.",

One interesting facet of this can be seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana over the course of a few weeks if there isn't anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, I can do better. After all, many important resources can't even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won't be a problem anymore, because you can just restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural resource or duplicate existing ones. \n You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana, duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane amounts of mana.",

A vast expanse of earth richly covered with grass, located in either an attachment to your warehouse, one of your other pocket dimensions or on a real world spot of your choice, this has exactly as much space as needed for its purposes. Which are twofold. \n Firstly, it has prime, finest-quality samples of every single herb, flower etc in existence. It doesn't matter how rare or valuable they are, you can find at least one of every one, and potentially many more. Plants breed and spread at rates proportional to their rarity and rates of breeding in the outside world. Something like the Emperor Awakening Heart Lotus, a plant normally found once in centuries or millennia, takes a full year to bloom, and others take proportionately lesser time. \n In future jumps the garden won't acquire any plants that are absolutely unique, like Yggdrasil in Norse Myth, but everything else is fair game, even divine or mythical plants of all types. And as for those plants, you need to find a seed and sow them here, at which point they become as any other plants. \n Additionally, this garden has the property of “adapting” any plants seeded here to the local settings. That is, a fruit that provides ki or magical energy in its original world would provide Profound Energy in this one, and the equivalent in future settings.

Inside one will find a few dozen crystals of Tenebrium growing, each large enough to produce a single ingot when smelted. Once harvested new crystals will slowly grow in their place over the course of a week. The mine is also capable of producing other metals, crystals, and even gemstones if given a sample of such material. These will form in veins along the walls of the tunnel, but grow much more slowly. Exotic metals will form at a rate of one ingot every two weeks and crystals will produce roughly the same amount. Gemstones seem to be easier and the mine will produce a collection of small stones that will fill a cupped hand in a week. Normal metals, like gold and silver, can also be produced at a rate of one ingot per week. An ingot here refers to enough material to forge a traditional longsword with.",

Before you is a great golden portal in the air, within which these endless treasures constantly shift and swirl before you. It is like a Gate, one that leads to the source of so much wonder. All that you can see is now yours and it is even more valuable than you might think at first. \n The power you now possess is to be the Collector of all of Humanity's creations. Every invention, every making, every forging, every last creation that mankind has created, is creating or will create is found within this endless vault of space. However, this only applies to singular creations. Any mundane and magical weapon or vehicle or potion or book or armour or anything else in that vein can be found present in here. However, outright locations cannot be found. While one may find the individual buildings in a city or collective fortress, they would not find the city itself. Nor will the vault contain things that are merely slight alterations to non-human objects. A mountain that has a castle on it or a stone stuck to a stick. Mankind has created a great many things but for it to apply to our vault's contents, it must be wholly a creation of man. A metal blade might be made from natural materials but it has been shaped and altered thoroughly through human processes. A last note on the contents of the vault, is that anything retained within it will not be harmful, even if it normally should be, to the owner of the vault while within this space and that you are able to use anything within this space, regardless of the normal conditions some magical items may have for their users. \n You can summon the vault's portals with a few moments concentration or through the turning of one of several golden keys from within this vault that you can obtain. These portals can be made anywhere within your sight range, even should you not be looking where you form them at the moment, and are very quick to open. While you do not know the exact nature or presence of everything within the dimensional space, you can instantly call anything from the vault to your person as you wish and search within it for anything that fits any kind of specifications you have in mind. With just a thought, you can even organise the space and it's contents however you might choose. Setting it up as a great golden museum instead of the endless desert of treasure, for example. \n Once you have opened the portal to your vault once, you can freely continue to open them at an incredible pace within your range, even dozens at once or enormous portals through which an entire castle could pass. Through these portals, you can bring forth anything within your vault, no matter how large or how far in. You may also choose to fire out things from within the vault, with the maximum speed that you can do so rising with your magical power. Even at a base level however, you can fire the smaller objects within at the speed of sound. Anything that exits the vault can be instantly retrieved with just a thought, replacing it within the vault due to the effects of an artefact. Due to the same magical item within the vault, anything that is sourced from the vault originally will slowly repair or, if destroyed, reappear entirely within the vault over the course of a few days. Items made for single uses however will not repair or reappear. The final and perhaps most notable attribute of this quality of yours is that your vault has not ceased growing. While the space only draws from this current timeline and world, as you travel to new worlds or timelines, you will find that the space you have access to will fill itself with all the achievements of humanity from each new world and timeline at an instant.",

Enough to build weapons and starships that can pose a serious threat to Earth and Apokolips. \n Additionally this station contains a small fragment of Brainiac itself. The fragment is currently inactive and safe to handle, and while it would be possible for a smart enough individual to reverse engineer Brainiac's most powerful technology from this thing it would come at the cost of possibly awaking the copy of the A.I hidden inside and If that were to happen it would quickly attempt to possess whoever or whatever was nearby to ensure it's continued survival, replication, and improvement. \n However someone would have to be as smart as Lex Luthor in order to even have a chance of reactivating this device. If you do manage to get it working however then you'll have a sample of the nanotech Brainiac uses to modify and possess living beings and assimilate alien technology. Aside from replicating the nanotech in this fragment you could also purposefully reawaken the copy of Brainiac stored within and try to use it for your own ends, but this really isn't recommended since it's a crazy murderous A.I that's only interesting in collecting knowledge. If you do manage to reawaken Brainiac it won't count as a companion.\n&emsp;• Braniac fragment is a part of this perk",

They all had their own discoveries and knowledge, potentially priceless things that were all lost nonetheless, to the relentless march of the Grimm. Not anymore, though. This is a complete, comprehensive collection of all the lost knowledge in the world! Anything that's lost to the world, through the destruction of a civilization, no one speaking the language, or other mishaps, can be found here, explained clearly and plainly, ready to be brought back. This covers everything from martial skills, scientific knowledge to cultural details like Art and the rest. But again, only things that are specifically not in circulation in any real capacity in the modern day and age. Things like the protection skills Jaune acquired from the Mistral libraries can be found here, hunter training methods in active use can't. If this needs to be said at this point, yes, this updates with the equivalent knowledge in all future jumps.\n&emsp;• Interestingly this is not limited to the planet, it covers every lost civ in the universe or possibly the local multiverse.",

        "Description": "The blueprints and schematics for the device known as the Timespinner. It is a form of temporal gateway that is capable of precisely sending a user through time into the past or future. The ordinary version has several limitations, the most important of which is that travelling through it is a one-way trip, and results in the removal of the traveller from history, leaving them as a person without a history on the other side. Similarly, until upgraded by Lachiemi science, the portal only allowed for travel through time, not space, and would deposit the user at the same point, relative to the planet they are on, in whatever era they targeted. \n This version has altered those restrictions. Firstly, it is capable of travelling through both space and time. Secondly, it has a recall function, which allows a user who has travelled through it to “snap back” to the device the moment after they went through, re-entering their old timeline at that point. \n The device does still retain the restriction that the timeline being travelled to will be one where the user never existed, but the recall function means that they can travel between that timeline and this one as they please. The third restriction is related to that, namely that this device can only target a single “new” timeline per person per Jump, and thus that as they travel around in the new timeline and make changes, they will be making changes to the same timeline, even when they shift back and forth between the old and new timelines. \n It is possible to bring back objects from the new timeline into the old timeline, or vice versa, but not people. Finally, this Timespinner has safeguards to ensure that no matter how much you mess with time, it will not cause an existential breakdown or destroy the universe (which could be a danger with the normal Timespinner, or that might just be a lie told by the Sandman). This purchase does come with the necessary materials to make a single Timespinner, which will replenish at the beginning of each new Jump. A Timespinner can only target times and spaces within the current Jump.\n&emsp;• Worse than the tardis but the protection feature is unique",

Each of these tomes is a copy of the personal notes of a powerful magus who researched and recorded at least one ritual. These notes are incredibly useful, containing several potent rituals, but that's not what's special about them. The real power in this library lies in something it lacks; the Interdict of Merlin. The books in this trove bypass the Interdict, allowing anyone who reads one to learn magic sealed behind that ancient law without the aid of another living mind.",

Learning and teaching from these books is easier than normal, enough to almost make up for a lack of an instructor. Lost or gifted books are replaced via owl order within one week at no cost to you. Yes, even if there's no logical way for an owl to reach you with a full set of magical textbooks. If your starting age is above 11, you're assumed to have been learning at an appropriate pace from these books for however long you've been at Hogwarts, or should have been at Hogwarts in the case of a Drop-In. Post-Jump, anyone studying from a set of magic textbooks which they own gains the ability to use Atlantean Magic. Gifted and re-gifted books never lose the magic-granting ability, stolen books do not grant magic until returned to the rightful owner.",

Its information was not limited to that about the Magus World and World of Gods; there was data about other worlds as well. There was a large bright hall past the entrance that could hold over a thousand people without becoming crowded. At the middle were hundreds of tables, and what looked like terminals, of which one can use to browse through the information the library has. Further in from the data terminals and the hall was the gigantic library that resembled a palace. Some sort of technique had been employed to expand the space within. At a glimpse, one would see bookshelves as massive as mountains, all so densely packed and numerous that there seemed to be no end.\n Upon visiting any Worlds/Jumps/Dimensions, the library also updates to contain every public information, including any data that you can easily acquire if you put your mind to it, of that Worlds and its neighbor, which include other dimensions. And will continuously update, self-correct and improve any information it has. As long as it's information that the spirit genie has a backup of, it can be duplicated as anything you want, such as books, scrolls, data pad, storage drive, etc, as long as you have the materials required. It can contain an immeasurable amount of data, and will never forget it. Even if the data has already been updated and improved or even if the timeline changes, it will still contain the old versions.\n You can place the Great Library in the real world, letting in all kinds of people to exchange for information, you can freely set the payment. Such as making it so that to obtain information inside, one needs to give it information that the library did not have, paying your preferred currencies to view it, or doing some mission you set out to gain access to it. It will be completely normal for everyone, and won't trigger any red flag, taxes, government authority, copyright infringement, Gods, World Will, etc. You can freely set which information is public, which requires payment, and which is never to be seen by the public. Its information can never be copied, stolen or otherwise accessed without your permission and knowledge.\n If it somehow is destroyed, it will return to your Warehouse/Personal Reality with none worse for the wear. Those other than you and your companions cannot use the library to access your Warehouse/Personal Reality.\n If you have the A.I. Chip, then it can always be connected to the Great Library.

It could take a hundred mortal lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this knowledge, though one who is Exalted above others might manage it in as little as one. It contains instructions on how to make all the various types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that were first created, these instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to the dread sickness that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity.\n This is only the knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this knowledge will need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own. The Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if they study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very long time indeed. While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained your Spark.\n Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the Alchemical Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself to. This, too, will be something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you have gained your Spark. As a reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process may have changed them both in looks and abilities they are people still. So unless you take them as companions, or have some other method of bringing them with you into future worlds, you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the process of making an Alchemical does not infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you have used this knowledge to force this condition upon the unwilling.",

To put it into perspective the spiritual force is the primer, and the spell model is the catalyst the primer remains the same, but under the effect of different catalysts, different types of energy particles will be attracted to it to form a different spell. Nowadays, spell models are very hard to find in this day and age especially if you do not possess any backing and it would be so rude if you were to be sent to a world as dangerous as this without any protection wouldn't it so for the prices set above you can purchase spell models.\n For 50 CP you can purchase rank 1-2 spell models.\n For 100 CP you can purchase rank 3-4 spell models.\n For 150 CP you can purchase rank 5-6 spell models.\n For 200 CP you can purchase rank 6-7 spell models.\n For 300 CP you can purchase rank 8-9 spell models.\n With each purchase you can buy 5 spells e.g. for 50 CP you can buy 5 rank 1 or 2 spells. Of course, you can purchase Wizard/Arcanist spell models here too. Or for a cost of 600 you may gain a book with every single spell ever developed in this setting, unfortunately it will not update in future jumps.\n&emsp;• Find the text of Magus Cultivation, Wizard Cultivation and High Grade Meditation Technique in Potion Grandmaster\n&emsp;• If you already have those perks then subtract 900 from the cost of this\n&emsp;• You need cultivation to use the spells so these extra perks are needed.",

It isn't limited to a single galaxy, but rather contains data from the entire universe in Neolife. Let alone several lifetimes, you'd probably need an entire planet worth of people sifting through those records for the same amount of time if you want to catalogue everything. \n But believe me, it is very much worth the effort. If you shared this with the galactic community, you'd be able to prevent many possible and very real problems from popping up, and everyone could get their foot in the door that much sooner. \n Perhaps even more interestingly, this USB stick will update itself as you travel to other worlds, granting you the same data about their own futures, and even works retroactively, covering settings you have been to in the past. Of course, that's only if they even have a future. Exactly from how far off in the future you get this data depends on how far along the society of a world is.

The greatest issue facing you is what cost is too great for innovation. By ignoring the morals of the modern world you may make great breakthroughs in magic and scientific research, learning far more from testing on unwilling subjects than would otherwise be expected, with prolonged excruciating torture of many subjects vastly increasing the likelihood of discovering something world changing over the standard procedures. Should you wish to retain your moral compass, however, you may instead receive a boost to your research and discoveries when adhering strictly to a moral code, with said boost increasing the more you go out of your way to adhere to it, altogether being just as effective, if not better, than any immoral alternatives that you might think.",

As one of the few who has maintained not only an interest in technology but knowledge of the scientific methods, you have developed what others might call techno-empathy. \n This is a deep, some would say fundamental, intuition into how machines function or fail to function as the case may be. You can intuit a machine's function or weaknesses simply by looking at it, as well as judge what it can do and how you can break them, and how to improve them simply by watching it run for a few moments. Not only that, but you know how to understand the fundamental psychology of a thinking machine, how to manipulate, limit, or liberate such a machine, and how to (perhaps) convince it not to seek to destroy or control humanity. \n You can fundamentally understand any machine or technology you're exposed to, though you'll have to experiment with it and test the limits of it to maximize this understanding. Note, this isn't Technopathic control over machines, merely the ability to feel how they function... of course, it also allows you to intuit any kind of machine password, no matter how unlikely cracking it might otherwise be.",

The release of the Hyperdrive design has led to a new arms race of unprecedented might but that also means you can end up caught completely off-guard. \n Over-extending your technological R&D into missiles might end up with your forces utterly outmatched if an enemy starts equipping their ships with masses of point defenses, ECM, and other anti-missile systems, and the same is true if you're built to defend against mass drivers and suddenly face ships with energy beams instead. \n If only you had a decent energy weapon or some Mass Drivers instead and now, you likely will. You and your people will find that any kind of military technology, be it weaponry, defenses, or any other such systems you need for your forces, is now merely the first option of many. The time and effort needed to develop alternative military options (based on existing but “lesser” methods you might possess) to match what you can already do is vastly reduced. \n So if your most powerful weapon is a Mass Driver of some sort (say a Quantum Driver), you could get your hands on Beam Weapons or Missile tech that are equally effective - except your opponent might not have suitable defenses for them. Likewise, if all you have is armor and your foes start using beam weapons, your desk will probably see a report or two on breakthroughs in shield technologies before the week is over. \n Furthermore, you'll find that adjusting any existing systems you have deployed is far easier than it otherwise was - modular components and interchangeable system parts ensuring that equipping your fleets with what they need to turn the tide is not going to stay a mere idea.",

This ability is heavily reliant on your resources, how difficult a problem the completely, incredibly different thing is, and pays out only in the long term, but it's worth it. \n In honor of Cave, I'll explain it using Aperture's history. In the 1940's the curtain company Aperture Fixtures tried to solve a problem that our Earth scientific community still has no definite answer for: the shower curtain effect. Somehow, Cave's engineers managed to solve it by creating a quantum tunnel between the inside and outside of a shower. \n In the 50's, they were researching that effect with funding second only to Black Mesa and used astronauts and Olympians as test subjects. They threw employee safety and retention out the window, disregarded every form of ethics imaginable, and were ultimately driven into an absurd level of bankruptcy thirty years later. \n Even when the company was on its last legs after GLaDOS was activated and tried to kill everyone with neurotoxin, she described the team at Aperture as being the greatest minds of a generation. This can be considered the perfect scenario for helping this perk function at full capacity. \n Fifty years of constant, no expenses spared, abnormally efficient research primarily focused on a single effect using a gigantic testing facility and eschewing all concerns except results. A Jumper doesn't have to disregard ethics to have the perk working at that level, but they'd need to use human equivalent robots like GLaDOS eventually did. \n What did that half century result in? They perfected the portal gun, which functions by harnessing and stabilizing a black hole in a device half the size of someone's arm. Ignoring the potential for free energy with careful use of portals, they built the black hole equivalent of a dyson sphere and used it to create tunnels in the fabric of reality. Why? Because fifty years ago, they wanted to make a really useful shower curtain. \n That's what this perk can look like. It's never clear when this perk is going to proc, but it will happen often enough to make the capstone worth taking. If the Jumper isn't helping it run at peak capacity or spending decades on one project, it'll result in innovations that are still useful but aren't on the level of the portal gun. Some examples are repulsion gel, storage containers that can survive the heat of the sun, tiny fusion reactors, and footwear that allows a human to jump off a building and land unharmed. Technologies researched with this ability can't always be generalized. The portal gun uses a black hole to tear holes in the fabric of reality, but that was the only thing Aperture could reliably do with one.

If you need to make a process more efficient, they can systematically go over all possible iterations, checking them one by one, simplifying one way, then another, and another, seeing what works and what doesn't. \n You always know how many steps you went up or down on a stairway, how long your stride was, how many windows you passed, and other such points of data. This doesn't give you bottomless memory, but the machine minds in the back of your head miss nothing, and can ponder anything and everything. \n They can even outperform a more brilliant mind, because they never dismiss anything and leave no stone unturned, even ones a more intuitive thinker would overlook. They excel at keeping the facts in mind, and only the facts. What they lack in creativity or innovation they make up for in being utterly systematic. \n You also find it easier to work methodically through things with your normal thoughts, and when you do you can work with the machine thoughts, using your intuition and creativity to help them overcome problems and find solutions faster. \n These extra thought trains always equal your normal ones in raw processing, but are otherwise crippled as described above. However, they will take on weakened shadows of any mental or social enhancing perks you possess. \n For example, if you have the Social Intelligence perk, they will pick up on social data, and can work with it despite not being creative or intuitive, processing through such data in bulk to help you solve larger social questions. They won't be as capable as if you focused on those things with your normal thoughts, but their methodical approach means they can handle bigger datasets then you can, and nothing stops you from considering the ideas and thoughts they come up with your normal less restricted thought processes.",

While you specialise in some field to extraordinary degrees, like being able to create artificial sparks if you choose “Von Neumann Clanks”, your genius is unbound by the petty concerns lesser sparks suffer from, allowing you to shine equally bright in every field from Microbiology to Trans-Dimensional Aeronautics. \n You have an instinctive grasp for scientific principles, can reverse engineer technology more or less just from seeing it, and have a head for calculation and numbers that defies belief. You can decrypt data in your head, have a completely flawless memory, and are in general the quintessential Mad Scientist. Complete with a gift for cackling and rants that can terrify anyone who isn't, by the way. \n When in the Madness Place, especially, you have an outright effect that allows you to warp time and space in a small area around you, letting you do weeks' worth of work in hours, and outright warp, twist, spindle the mutilate the very laws of physics as you craft your wonders... and horrors. Apart from the SCIENCE!, you have a charisma that borders on mind control, as anyone without a spark, or an exceptionally strong willpower is drawn into your orbit by your sheer force of will, ready to help and serve wherever they can. Your body is also somewhat better than most, allowing you to go all those all-nighters without food and fight off highly trained fighters while barely paying attention. \n Exemplar Boosted Your talents with the sparks cross the basic boundaries all the way, transforming you into something altogether beyond. You have had the second breakthrough, the transformation that makes you from a Spark into true Spark Royalty! You are like one of the Immortal God-Queens of old, of which only a precious few remain today. \n You're not a fully grown, matured God-Spark like Albia, but you're further along than Agatha or Lord Snackleford. Along with having psychic powers like levitation and telepathy, you can release blasts of pure energy to scour your foes from the earth. You can see in more than three dimensions, and even interact with beings beyond the mortal plane in several ways. You have the power to shapeshift freely, going from giant to normal in an instant, and acquiring any colour, appearance or form you desire. \n You can possess willing subjects, and break any mind control or subversion on your subjects. You can control energy in various forms, most of them rather unspecified. Most importantly, of course, your talents with actual Sparking transcend any ordinary sparks entirely, being almost as much beyond them as they are beyond mundane scientists. You have a surfeit of ideas, almost as if you can do anything! \n You don't even need to bother with Madness Places very much anymore, that is, being “Suspended in an Eternal Moment of Supreme Clarity”. You do retain your ability to scare lesser minds out of their skin just by talking. Oh, and you gain a rotating Halo of any symbols of your choice, turning around your head in an endless circle. Basically, you have somewhat weaker versions of any powers displayed by Albia, even those not mentioned here. And you would grow to match her as soon as you acquire enough experience.

Yours is the mastery of all the sciences and arts of the world, from the biological expertise to the chemical and the magical, needed to craft all the wonders and miracles that exist in this time and place. \n With this blessing your intelligence, speed of thought, and aptitude towards any and all fields of science and magic both are heightened to tremendous, absurd degrees. Your memory is limitless and unalterable, and your ability to recall it instant and flawless. You can think and do any number of things at once, possessing truly unlimited multitasking. \n Combined with Yajnatek, you will be able to summon and bind gods, lay down bindings of fate in the forms of boons and curses, craft great works of magic that make and break empires, and more. At the same time, your scientific aptitude would let you craft gadgets and wonders like the Vimanas, Godly weapons and armor any deity or Super warrior would be proud to wield, or even wonders like the Rishi Computer Markandeya, or even works like the Maya Mahal, the palace of wonders from where Yudish once ruled. \n You can also combine any and all of your gifts, crafting together technology, psionics and magic into works that can do anything either can, as well as machines to cast magic, and others that combine the best of both worlds to achieve even greater results.",

After all, who knows when you will next be able to get your hands on one? Well, fear no more! Now when you break something down for resources, you can make a blueprint for it. So you can build it later, or even make even more of them. And if you don't want to break it down for resources, you can also be careful to just take it apart into its constituent parts, learn what every little thing does, and then put it back together. And you now have a blueprint you can use to make copies. Blueprints for everyoneJumper! Capstone boosted: Having an AI observing everything you do may be creepy, but at least it's willing to give you tips for improving. Like how to improve the things you are building. Every time you build something, you can now improve it somehow, just a little bit. Take a little weight off here, shave that down, and after enough, you might have a whole new toy in your hands. Any improvements you make will be added on to the blueprint, so you can further improve it from there. It may not seem like much, but if you build a Mk X gun 100 times, your improved blueprint might very well qualify for Mk XI status, or maybe even better. You can keep improving that blueprint as much as you like.",

When you think about it, a spaceship is just a really big car, right? You can also hack into things with wires or machinery... though it might take a little trial and error to get it right, depending on how advanced it is and how smart you are.

No object or piece of technology whether it be slightly ahead of modern times to the cosmic magitech of the future can't be understood by you. \n As mentioned above objects and technology in this sense even has a very loose definition as it can range from robots, indestructible metal, swords that grant the power of gods, to even the ultimate of Macguffins. You'll be able to reverse engineer and mass produce practically anything you want from in a cave with a box of scraps. The objects will always contain their original properties but you can go further beyond that. You can alter the properties, strengthen them, weaken them, make it so only select people can wield them, and much more.

You have an instinctive understanding of how to make different alloys, and you can even break down existing metals and reshape them, without the metals weakening. \n Farming Specialty You have an instinctive knowledge of how to make plants grow, even those with more exotic requirements. Plants under your care will flourish, even those that might normally require extremely delicate care, and best of all, the growth of any plants in your care is extremely accelerated. Plants that might take months to produce a harvest will grow to fruition in mere weeks, or possibly even days. \n Kitchen Specialty You are a whiz in the kitchen, capable of making dishes with a variety of health benefits, that also happen to be both filling and delicious. The foods that you make will actually produce tangible bonuses in those that eat them, starting with enhanced healing, and branching out into increased strength, agility, energy, resistance to heat or flame, to such exotic effects as glowing in the dark or damaging those that touch you. \n Medicine Specialty You can make a variety of medical treatments, suitable for handling a wide range of bumps, bruises, burns, and more. Your treatments will have boosted effectiveness, with everything from your bandages on up promoting healing beyond the norm. You also know how to make certain chemical stimulants, which can safely (and non-addictively) provide a boost to those who use them. \n Tech Specialty Beyond the twelve basic Techs, there are many more possibilities for implanted tech-based abilities. With this perk, you gain the ability to craft techs for yourself, which could perform functions such as creating a temporary sphere of null gravity around you, giving you a short ranged burst of super-speed, allowing you to shoot energy from the soles of your feet to fly, or even giving you a short-range, line-of-sight teleport. You will have to work out how to craft these abilities for implanting, and you'll have greater success with designing tech-based versions of movement abilities that you already possess.

A particularly despised design (mostly by enemies, sometimes by allies) are electrified cogs designed to drain mana and harm any enemies who draw near. Also includes the groundwork for a suit of armor able to stand up against mythic beasts and sorcery alike, giving you the strength of an army and protection stronger than most bunkers. While some would overlook it, grappling hooks can be projected enormously well with some of these mechanisms, allowing you to fly across battlefields. \n Aircrafts: While most have long since accepted the idea of mechanical flight to be impossible, some Keen have held on to the dream, you included. At last, it has paid off. You've gotten a basic design for a fully functioning flying machine, able to mount weapons and withstand some amount of stress. Expanding that into something good for transport (the initial design might hold up to two people, if you give up fighting) is your prerogative, but really? YOU'VE DEVELOPED FLIGHT! TAKE THAT, STUPID WIZARDS! \n Guns: Exactly what it sounds like. Tubular devices which discharge projectiles at high speeds, there's no muss or fuss about what it does, even if making a good design might be fiddly. Includes good prototypes for personal firearms such as rifles and light artillery such as cannons. Groundwork to scale upwards for versions mounted on ships, castles, or flying devices is included, but finalization is your job.",

Any combat utility is purely incidental... but certainly welcomed. \n Rocketry: Projectiles propelled by internal combustion. It's simple, some would call it crude, but it works. Includes the underlying theory behind heat-seekers, intercontinental systems, homing technology, and of course, explosives. Although, everything other than that last one will likely require some personal touches to maximize combat ability. \n Robotics: Simple and clean, it is the construction of independently moving machinery, otherwise known as robots. Does not include much in the way of AI. Basic designs are better than any knight, but numbers are the best bet against most enemies to be found here unless you devote significant time towards the construction of any given craft.

Either way, while you are only able to study dimensional and spatial anomalies caused by other sources for now, the idea of crossing continents with the press of a button, calling resources and tools from faraway bases and workshops then sending them back home once you're done, and exploring new universes entirely remains a very realistic goal. Just, keep in mind that there's plenty of nightmarish monstrosities sitting around our reality which would just love it if some schmuck opened the door for them. I reckon that'll probably stop being a problem for you in a decade's time, but still. \n Chainsaws, Chains, Saws, and General Anti-Flora Equipment: Besides the utility for wood harvesting purposes, you also have great knowledge of what to do with wood itself, being able to engineer around wood's strong and weak points in order to replace metal during the construction of things such as armor or general machinery. Why, you could even create a suit of armor able to cut down forests in record time while defending from any attacking trees, saw whirling around you as an active defense, chains pulling you along while tearing leafage from its foundation, and your main blade spinning around the battlefield to cut down any straggling trees.

        "Description": "All machines in this world have a number of computer chips within them. Called Plug In Chips, they allow the being in question to turn on, maintain operation and control what senses they have. For free for any origin save Strange Being, you gain the basic set of Plug In Chips that allow you to function and interact with the world. YoRHa agents will gain a few extra chips that allow them to have a basic HUD, similar to a video game, containing features such as a health measurement system, a map and so on. Plug In Chips can upgrade the functions of a robot's body, making them faster or improving their mental faculties or even giving them incredible new abilities but all robots can only handle so much increased power due to these Chips, though that storage can be upgraded. You'll need to find or buy more Chips to gain such effects however. For 200CP this option may be upgraded. You now gain a few dozen Chips of varying uses, from attack enhancers to things that will automatically collect loot for you in a short area around you. You don't have every Plug In Chip in the game nor can you hold more than the normal max storage for a YoRHa unit but you are instead given the knowledge on how to create and combine Plug In Chips of your own, as well as how to upgrade storage capacity. Just keep in mind how expensive the process can be.",

Just the other day you came across a Doctor, who explained to you his hypothesis about how things can be both a wave... and a particle at the same time. While it all really fascinates you, you figure he had some sort of reason for saying it. It turns out he has an “experimental” technology that requires a power source he can't find. Without it, he can't test out his hypothesis. But you might not have that same problem... asking him for his notes, you've figured out enough to make a breakthrough. Your magic energy is enough to provide the necessary activation energy, and it'll drain you for as long as it's functioning, but you can convert freely between bullets and lasers, such that your gatling gun will now spray laser beams, while your laser cannon can fire heavy shell rounds, your missiles can explode into plasma, and so forth.

Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil. \n Nano Karmatron Theory Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness. \n It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs.

Slimes are also powerfully acidic and can inflict grievous acid damage on anything they touch; you naturally possess the ability to determine whether or not your acid will damage the things you are in contact with.

These wisps are also touched by the memories and emotions of the being's life, altering its properties somewhat. The collection and manipulation of these wisps of Mist are the basis on which Mistlight Manifestations come into existence. \n Collecting a wisp of Mist is easy, simply touching it will stabilize it and allow it to be stored indefinitely. But utilizing a single wisp of Mist to create a Mistlight Manifestation will result in a lackluster Manifestation, weak enough that even humans, who lack the reserves of light necessary to become proper hunters, prefer to make at least a few modifications before doing so. To that end, there are three methods of strengthening a wisp. \n First is smelting or fusing. Taking two or more wisps of Mist and combining them into a single, new one with the traits of both. This is by far the easiest and fastest method of empowering a wisp of Mist. However, unless you know exactly what your wisps of Mist are and how they'll react, combining them in this way may lead to complications, such as opposing traits canceling out or mutating into a new trait that has a negative impact on the whole. \n Second is cultivation. By “feeding” a wisp of Mist, it is allowed to grow organically and produce new qualities and traits over time. Allowing a wisp of Mist to grow in this way is fairly simple, and with its organic growth it's unlikely to have any complications, but this process is time consuming, potentially taking weeks or months to yield the results on par with smelting or refinement. \n Lastly is refinement. This is a rather difficult process that removes unwanted traits from a wisp of Mist, much like cutting and polishing a gem. This process has you excise traits and qualities from a wisp of Mist, allowing the other aspects to grow in strength as a result. This is a quick process and is unlikely to cause any real trouble, but you must be very precise and careful during the process or you may leave behind bits of what you wanted removed. \n Additionally, wisps of Mist are useful for another purpose. By binding a wisp to a Seed, it can act as an artificial Lens in the use of Seed Sorcery. Seeds formed with a wisp are, however, slower to grow than those that use your own Lenses. Cracking a Seed with a wisp will often cause the wisp to dissipate, though some Seed Sorcerer's have learned how to reclaim the wisp used for this prior to cracking the Seed.",

It's not like you would implant them in little girls and then harvest their blood for larger amounts of ADAM. That would be monstrous. The slugs come in a small aquarium that won't need maintenance to keep them alive and will refill to contain six slugs every week. Just keep the lid on. They like to wander.",

        "Description": "Potioneering is the art of using ingredients both from the natural world and from the body of powerful beasts to create powerful concoctions with an incredible range of effects. From increasing spiritual force, to creating powerful attacks that can be combined to create stronger attacks, to poisons that can kill Magus of a higher rank before they can even notice, to elixirs that can help increase vitality or help to purify a Warlock's bloodline. With time and ingredients, a potioneer grandmaster can create potions for every situation and event. From Acolytes to Rank 9 Magus all Magi of each rank require potions. \n You are as the name suggests now, a Grandmaster of the art with a masterful aptitude to potion making as well as the knowledge of how a wide variety of ingredients interact. Allowing you to make leaps in the process of potion making as well as creating new or re-making old ones that would for other potioneers take decades of mind-breaking work. Of course, you wouldn't be a grandmaster with just knowledge, would you. So this comes with a 100 years of actual experience in the art, as well as a host of knowledge of all recipes found in this world barring those lost to the world. But hell maybe you can find them one day. \n For another 300 CP you also gain the knowledge and skills of an Alchemical Grandmaster, which are experts in the creation of all kinds of magical items. From defensive items that protect from attacks of other mages, to one shot attacks that contain far greater power than the actual creator. But remember, the quality of an item is not just dependent on the creator but the materials as well.",

To improve and advance through the ranks of Acolytes, an Acolyte must improve their spiritual force to reach a certain number, and have to construct mind runes with each level increasing the number of mind runes being needed. To advance to a rank 1 Magus, an Acolyte requires their spiritual force to reach a certain number, a rank 1 spell model and either Grine water or a high-grade meditation technique. \n From Magus rank 1 to 2 a Magus's spiritual force must reach 80 and their elemental conversion must reach over 80%, with 99% being the maximum being reached. To advance further from rank 2-6, can simply be done by improving spiritual and soul force. From 6-8 is done by comprehending different laws and smelting those laws into their own and finding your own path. Then comprehending the laws of space and time into your own path to reach rank 9. What many do not know is that there is a 10th rank that can only be reached by creating a greater law.",

        "Cost": 500,
        "Description": "In the World of Gods, there exist many different classes and many ways to reach stronger tiers of power. There are also ranks and tiers, to become stronger a being must reach rank 20 to become Legendary and from there can advance from a Demigod to a Greater God and eventually can become an Overgod. \n The most powerful class here are Wizards, magic casters who utilize the Weave, a creation of one of the Greater Gods. The way Wizards work is by paying spiritual force to the Goddess Of The Weave to buy the authority to use magic, this manifests as spell slots. Each Wizard gains an additional spell slot as they advance in rank, with them gaining access to deeper levels of the Weave as they reach certain milestones. However as soon as they use the spells they lose the memory of the spell models. Drop-In starts out at Wizard Rank 1, Acolyte's Wizard Rank 4, Old Monster Rank 6 and Mortals start out with nothing. \n Before you get too excited, Wizards come with drawbacks you see. As you are using spiritual energy to pay for spell models to insert into the spell slots. It doesn't matter how much spiritual force you possess, as the same amount is needed to pay for all the different ranks of spells. If you use all the spells and have none left you will be powerless unless you use scrolls. Also as soon as you have cast the spells, the spell models you see within the Weave are forgotten. \n For 300 CP, whether as a result of luck or bloodline you are not a Wizard but an Arcanist, an attempt by Ancient Magi to merge the power of a Wizard and a Magi. Arcanists are the founding fathers of Wizardry, able to supersede the Weave's restrictions. By perceiving the energies in the environment and utilizing the elemental particles in the air, they can draw it to form arcane spells. So long as an Arcanist has enough arcane energy and the correct spell models, any spell under the legendary realm can be cast (that limitation is only if the Arcanist themselves are not in the legendary realm). They also possess the passive ability to amplify arcane energy by 10-20% when they cast spells. Arcanists can also remember any and all spell models within the Weave. \n Now, if you think that isn't worth 300 CP there is something you should know Arcanists aren't simply battle spellcasters an Arcanist can do anything a Magi can; alchemy, enchanting, force-fields Arcanists are Magi with the ability to utilize the Weave and are not suppressed by the World Of The Gods. In order for an Arcanist to advance requires their spiritual/soul force to grow as well as comprehension and sensing of arcane energy. \n Now, you are probably thinking that isn't good enough especially the Wizard option and you would be right so for just an extra 200 CP you are not tied to Myastra's weave anyone but to your very own. Just like Shar has her Shadow Weave you now have the Jumper Weave (name totally your decision). This weave possesses all the spells and features Myastra's does but is totally under your control giving you access to every inch of it. Unlike Myastra's, your Weave is linked to every jump you go to from now or from the past to the future allowing you access to it whenever and wherever. Oh and don't worry about it getting destroyed no one will ever notice it.",

        "Description": "When it comes to advancing into an official Magus there are two ways this can happen either through Grine water or a high grade meditation technique. The difference between the two being that through the former you could turn a spell 1 model of your choice into your own innate one however with this method when you wished to advance later on if the spell model you chose was incompatible with your earlier ones it could result in the Magus's death as well as the fact the Grine water damages the Magus's spiritual force preventing further advancement, the latter using techniques is far greater as the technique itself provides the Magus with innate complementary spell models. With this perk, you can purchase your own meditation techniques whether canon or one you thought of yourself and yes this includes Warlock techniques. You can purchase as many as you wish for 200/400 CP each. \n For 200 CP: The technique will be limited to the Breaking Dawn Realm or Rank 6 Magus/Warlock and with just this technique you will no longer be able to advance further as Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher needs to comprehend Laws to advance. \n For 400 CP: Normally meditation techniques would be useless at Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher but this one is special as it compliments your elemental affinities allowing you to gain comprehension on the laws based on your elemental affinities thus allowing you to reach and become a Rank 9 Magus/Warlock. There is no limit to the rank you will be able to reach with this one day reach rank 9 of course, just because you have the way doesn't mean you WILL reach it after all talent is everything and for rank 9 you still require comprehension of space and time this method only gives you a path to that rank that will never cripple you. \n Post-Jump meditation techniques works in cultivation jumps as its equivalent to the highest quality version of cultivation techniques, for 200 CP version it would only allow you to reach half of the cultivation path meaning if there are 12 ranks you can only reach peak of Rank 6, for 400 CP version would allow you to reach Rank 12 or the highest level of Cultivation. \n If there are two or more cultivations paths like cultivating the body and ki, the meditation techniques would become a two in one that cultivates both body and ki, if there are more cultivating path like body, mind, soul and ki, the meditation techniques would become a four in one that cultivates all paths. \n If you already have Magus Cultivation, Wizard Cultivation and High Grade Meditation Technique then subtract 900 from the cost of this \n You need higher and higher cultivation to craft those items, pills and potions so these extra perks are needed.",

        "Description": "The art of geomancy (known as feng shui in the East) is the study of harmonizing the physical environment with the flow of energy. The goal of feng-shui is to create the ideal place to live or work. Through a combination of architectural design and mystic mathematics, a geomancer plans a pattern that must be duplicated within the entire structure (in the case of a building) or the layout of a room or series of connected rooms (in the case of interior design). Implementing this design increases the time required and the cost of the work involved, but practitioners consider it well worth the effort. When designing a geomancy effect, the thaumaturge chooses a single Attribute or Skill to be the focus. \n Once assigned, the Trait cannot be changed without completely redesigning the location. Attribute-based designs are more difficult to create than Skill-based ones. The selected Trait must reflect the building or space's function. For example, a library might enhance academic or research skills. If the thaumaturge is successful, she creates a unique design that benefits those who use the location in the manner for which it was created, provided that the design is followed perfectly. If the thaumaturge creates her geomancy design successfully, and the architect or interior designer successfully integrates the design into the physical location, the flow of energy is modified within the space. Any action that takes place in the space using the designated Attribute or Skill may gain a bonus. \n Once a geomantic design is created and implemented, it remains in effect indefinitely unless something happens to disrupt or change the flow of energy. Natural disasters may change the magical landscape more than they appear to affect it physically, requiring geomantic designs to be realigned. New construction or destruction of buildings or even spaces within a building may require that a thaumaturge reassess the location for potential updates. Poorly designed geomantic locations may disrupt those around them, as well. The only limits on the number of designs a geomancer may create are her time, her capability and the ability of others to come up with the resources to put her designs into place.",

At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like a magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them. \n Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you're skilled in both of them, enough that you'll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself. \n With some experimentation, you'll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, after which you enchant the finished sword one last time after its completion. \n Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments like man made ones in them. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement of their aura, allowing for the creation of a staff that can match up to any plasma weapon, or a bow that will never miss its mark. \n You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continue to research and experiment, you'll also be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn't. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even something on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you. And considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might've thought, starting at a level others would need years to reach. \n You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment's notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you're doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you'll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you're attempting. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill.",

Using these focuses in concert with the original power within your body will see your might with these abilities enhanced dramatically. Alternatively, you could loan these items to allies and subordinates to grant them access to these powers. Objects that you infuse with your power are also infused with your will. This allows them to act independently to enact your will, and enables them to refuse others the right to use the power they grant. You may only create one focus per power, and a given item can only contain one power at a time. When these items are destroyed, the power flows back into you, and you can create a new focus for it. \n Boosted: Your power has risen to new heights in a number of different ways. Firstly, you are capable of creating multiple focuses for the same ability with no loss in their overall power level, and using the same item as a focus for more than a single ability. The true strength of this ability, however, is that each and every one of your powers has become semi-sentient being of its own, a kind of pseudo-consciousness based on your will attached to the ability. These consciousnesses are aligned with you in terms of morality and intent, and can add their force of will to yours. When you work in concert with them, your precision, control, and raw power output increase without any additional exertion on your part. Furthermore, in the event that you are incapacitated in some fashion, these consciousnesses can take control of your body, wielding the power they are attached to in order to protect your body until you return. Alternatively, you could grant your powers control of your body while you fully devote your mind to other tasks. Because of this boost, you may choose to make your focuses tangible avatars of your individual powers, turning them from semi-sentient objects to fully sapient ones.

All of this knowledge and more is now passed on to you, as you find yourself a master of Formations, their creation, and their utilization, as well as heavy insight into the Grand Dao of Formations. With a year of practice and the proper reagents, you could even conceivably create formations of the scope which caused the four thousand kilometer wide elemental stone mine in the Ji Clan's territory through the gathering of elemental energy, and with a decade, setting down formations like ones that would normally be set around the Ji Clan territory, capable of killing Celestial Immortals, could be qualified as a warm up (depending on your own level of power of course) Creating a formation such as the Rahu Formation that allows a multitude of cultivators to band together in order to form an avatar that is vastly stronger than the sum of its parts would take you a decade or so of research (once again, that is if you had the required level of power for it). Keep in mind, however, that creating formations also requires insight into the Daos. Creating a Wind Formation will be absolutely impossible without the necessary insight into the Dao of Wind. \n To add to this, you also gain tremendous insight into the Grand Dao of Constructs, allowing you to, with enough practice, create golems equal to the Daofather Golems that the Lord of All Things created, and make them in bulk just as he did.

At first, you'll simply be able to make one or two of them at the Xiantian Level, with their children only being at the Houtian Realm, and only in their dozens. But as your own personal power increases, you could create or upgrade queens capable of rivaling even Empyrean Gods and cultivators stronger stall, with them being capable of birthing thousands of lesser creatures. The intelligence of their spawn is also variable, with some of the weaker grunts simply being like insects that the Queens can see through and puppet from a distance, and their generals being at the very top of the level they were spawned at and being just as intelligent as the Queens. This scales with your cultivation level as the Golems or Queens are always one level below you. In future Jumps you'll find yourself picking up arts and abilities similar to constructs and formations incredibly quickly.",

        "Description": "In this world, people use the art of cultivation to increase their powers. This practice is mostly divided into two ranks: Ki refiners, who generally rely on magical techniques and treasures to fight, powered by the Elemental Essences they absorb, and Fiendgod Body Refiners, who strive to turn their bodies into those of the ancient Fiendgods and utilize divine abilities with vastly varying effects, such as increasing their size, adding extra arms, or even strengthening their bodies beyond their already impressive levels, making their physical abilities and general battle prowess much higher than those of a Ki refiner in exchange for lacking the ability to use treasures and weapons. Thus you get a technique from each of these two types of cultivation to study. Be warned though, that although Fiendgod Body Refiners are much more powerful, their ways of cultivation may be painful to the extreme, or extremely hard to advance in, resulting in decades of effort for just a bit of progress. \n There are many stages to cultivation, starting with the Houtian Stage, which signals the very start of a journey, as well as the increase of a cultivator's lifespan to over a hundred years. Then comes the Xiantian Stage, where the body is completely reforged for perfection, and the cultivator's lifespan increases to over two hundred years. The third stage is called Zifu, in which the practitioner forms their own Violet Palace which contains their liquified Ki energy, and enables them to live over four hundred years. The fourth stage, called Wanxiang, is the stage of manifestation, where the practitioner gains access to Divine Will, and increases their lifespan to eight hundred years. The fifth stage, called Primal, gives the practitioner the ability to live forever* (not actually forever)*, with no limits on their lifespan After that comes the Void or Earth mmortal Stage. When a practitioner reaches the Void Stage and attempts to progress to the next level. they shall be met with a final Tribulation. This is a test sent down by the heavens in the form of heavenly wind, fire, and lightning strikes that they must either bear or face total soul annihilation. Then they must pass a test of their Dao Heart in the form of the Demonheart Tribulation, where they shall be tested to see if they are truly dedicated in the matters of Cultivation, and whether they are willing to abandon everything for its sake, though it can be resisted with a powerful Heartforce. If they succeed in this Tribulation, they shall reach the Celestial Immortal Stage, or, in the case of Body Refiners, the Empyrean God Stage, where they shall break free of the mortal coil and the five elements. After that, there are two more stages for both paths of Cultivation: True Immortal for Ki Refiners, or True God for Body Refiners, and then Daofather for Ki Refiners, and Elder God for Body Refiners. Finally, there is the very pinnacle of power in the Three Realms, the World level. This is the level of cultivation Pangu was at when he created the Pangu Chaosworld, and Nuwa similarly reached. While there are even higher levels of power to be grasped, they need not be mentioned for now, and you won't be able to reach them during this jump. \n On a final note, once every three hundred years after a practitioner steps into the Zifu Realm, they will be met with a minor tribulation, which will build up in power until finally, they shall face one major tribulation every nine hundred years. Three centuries a Tribulation, nine a Calamity, this shall continue until they either reach the Celestial Immortal stage, or have their souls shattered. For the purposes of this perk you'll be given a technique in both Body Refining and Ki Refining that will last you until the Wanxiang Stage, at which point you'll have to fend for yourself. For 50 CP you can get one that will allow you to advance to the Celestial Immortal and Empyrean God level, using both types of cultivation. Regardless of whether you buy the technique that allows you to train to the Celestial Immortal/Empyrean God level or not, the technique you get is of the highest quality, and you won't need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it. Your cultivation technique may be aligned towards whatever Dao you wish it to be.",

The same goes for people; as even the most skilled warrior might run into problems such as their inability to walk on water. However, through the power of SCIENCE all things are possible! \n Through acts of technological wizardry you're capable of creating special “programs” you can “install” in both objects and living beings to modify their abilities, or how they interact with the environment. Something like water walking would be the work of a few hours of coding; while creating a false wall would take only a few minutes. \n Greater yet is the possibility of improving lifeforms. Such as finding ways to “overclock” them for a significant but temporary boost in ability; though the strain such things may cause will require their cautious use and application. However, with patience and a dedicated subject you can study intimately it may be possible to chip away at a creatures limitations, or program new capabilities derived from their existing traits; slowly but surely improving them through incremental steps. Though take care when doing so, as the more that you push them with a single alteration the greater the risk you expose your subject to. That said, a little danger is nothing a brilliant mind like yourself is unfamiliar with.",

While these can be designed to perform simple mechanical tasks, they can also duplicate spell effects, and, with extra effort, they can be awakened, granting them magic resistance, the intelligence of an average human and a personality based on their form and materials. \n For example, a mechanical snake might be deceptive and prone to telling lies, while a being made from iron may be particularly stubborn. A being awakened this way begins its life very loyal to its creator, and will likely remain that way as long as it is not mistreated. Creating Mechanica does not require vis despite the fact that they will operate indefinitely if kept safe and well-maintained.

The making of such artifacts requires the pure form of the dark and acrid liquid known as vitriol, and the binding of demons into these relics, dissolving their forms and integrating their still-living Essences into their creation. \n Under an infernal artisan's ministrations, pure vitriol serves as a catalyst. Objects bathed in it are seared free of weakness, making them as strong as any of Creation's magical materials; component parts flow together and intermingle, amalgamating into a unified whole. Where an artificer in Creation would spend months carving and shaping an artifact's components, his Malfean counterpart immerses them in vitriol and guides their slow, inextricable melding. Then, one slowly integrates the dissolved form of a living demon, known as Chalcanth or Azoth depending on their power, into the device's nascent structure. \n A demon must be of sufficient stature to match the power of a relic in order to bond with it, and likewise must its nature also accord with the relic's function if the procedure is to succeed. Now you too will join the ranks of hell's greatest artisans, with knowledge and skill that encompasses vitriol itself, the acids and catalysts derived from it and its use in the crafting of infernal relics. \n Your knowledge encompasses much understanding of demonic Essence, as well as the instinctive ability to use the appropriate mundane crafts to use together with vitriol as the catalyst. Bonding the Chalcanth to a Brass blade of your own design shall be a labor almost considered easy to an craftsman of your skill. Likewise the arts of demonic magi-technology and the creation and modification of life through vitalizing essence are known and practised by you, though their applications are somewhat more complex. As one of Hell's master artisans you may even surpass the limitations of the dull and feeble demonic essence contained within your creations, to instill them with a demonic will as a true Hellforged wonder with its own intellect and awakened essence.",

        "Description": "You're a full-fledged member of the White Council, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that entails. A lot of times that's more hassle than it's worth, especially with a war on, but there's a lot of resources you can call on when you need to, as long as you're prepared to repay the favor when need be. What this background really gets you is the full training a wizarding background offers, which has left you able to call on the entire array of everything magic is capable of. And, with enough time and preparation, there's very little which doesn't fit within that category. One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in “When all you have is a hammer” scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation. \n 1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law. \n 2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target. \n 3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience. \n 4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one. \n 5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line. \n 6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands. \n 7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the “local” Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters. \n Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree. \n They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.",

Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram.

Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example. \n It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It's good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won't ever happen. It wouldn't be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan. \n So long as you have an example to study, you'll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms.

This means that you can essentially choose to integrate your two cultivations together and boost your Spiritual Power to high levels immediately, or keep them separate. The cultivation of the Thousand Worlds goes several realms higher than that of Dou Qi, so it can become much stronger. There are 12 stages of the cultivation of Spiritual Power, with each stage being split into a variety of levels. In the more backwater places, you would be lucky to find someone who has reached the level of Heavenly Fusion, while in the more populated areas it is not uncommon to find Sovereign class cultivators. \n In the Spirit Stage of the Spiritual Energy cultivation path, one has the ability to ingest the Soul Essence of a Spiritual Beast. However, there is a limit to the Soul Essence. As you get stronger, the Soul Essence that you have refined before will gradually lose its effect. This means that most essences will lose their effect before the Heavenly Completion Stage. However, if the Soul Essence that you have refined is powerful enough, the power will still remain even in the later level, giving those that have them an edge. \n Reaching the Sovereign Stage marks a major change in your cultivation. One must pass through 3 “disasters” where your body, energy, and soul are refined to a higher grade, yet failure is easy and can carry fatal consequences. Once you reach pass these trials and reach the Sovereign stage you will gain the Sovereign Sea, which is a much more powerful container for your Spiritual Power. The spiritual energy itself of Sovereign Masters possesses unique attributes. Some people's spiritual energies are cold in nature, and some are blazing hot. This is because their spiritual energies have their own sagacities depending on what kind of energies they take in and have attuned it to. \n Sovereigns also gain the ability to cultivate a Sovereigns Body which, depending on the rank, can give them great physical power. There are certain Celestial Body techniques one can cultivate to gain a more powerful Sovereigns Body, though they are often closely guarded secrets of clans. \n By pouring your Spiritual Power into someone else, you can awaken their ability to cultivate, not that that will do them much good without further guidance.",

        "Description": "Ritual magic is an extensive form of arcane practice that allows those using it to accomplish great works even as fairly weak mages. You have gained considerable knowledge, both practical and theoretical, on the workings of ritual magic and, by extension, sacrificial blood magic. This allows you to create far reaching and incredibly powerful spell matrices that can be supplied over time by anyone, or fuelled by the life force of sacrificed creatures or blood. Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump.",

        "Description": "Forger of Giants: Your talents of craft extend to the direct creation and modification of living beings. You have the ability to craft life itself. While you cannot make life from nothing, you can harness any source of life or spirit to create a soul for a living being. Without a source you may still make complicated facsimiles of life similar to A.I. and or elementals. You may forge, re-forge, temper, purify, and heal any kind of mind, spirit, body, or soul cleaning it of corruption, deterioration, disease, tarnish, blemish or error, strengthening it against harm or others interference. While you do have the ability to do the same to even yourself, it will take a great deal of time or power, as you were crafted by the titans themselves and already tempered to such an extent to be able to wage war against the corrupting and chaotic forces of the old gods and elementals. Your ability to craft and uplift bodies and souls allows you to create races up to a similar power and form as the Mogu, Tol'vir, Iron Vrykul, Earthen, and Giants. You have the ability to resurrect any being weaker than yourself into its original body or into a new body up to a form you could create, as long as a beings, mind, spirit, soul hasn't been captured or restrained you can resurrect it freely, even if its essence is being restrained. You have the ability to transition between the realms of the living and the dead, attack incorporeal beings with physical matter and even if a soul is destroyed as long as you can find even a fragment of it or the being that destroyed it you can use the fragment or shatter the destroyers soul to re-forge the original soul, you may need a source of life or spirit to rebuild it as if creating a new soul from scratch. \n You May Choose: Priest \n Enhanced: Given the same amount of time and effort you could create beings on par with the titanic-watchers themselves, elevate the proto-dragons into full dragons, or raise the dead as Val'kyr. But now given enough time those are not limitations to what you can create, given enough time to forge and craft you could create a being to rival anything, old god, naaru, dragon aspect there is no limit as long as you have the time to forge strengthen and imbue more energy or craft with better materials. The stronger and more skilled you grow the faster this process becomes. The life you create can be given extraordinary abilities to travel between the realms of the living and dead or the dream interacting with such realms with ease. You could craft intangible or incorporeal bodies, or forms made of living lighting. Even without access to spirit you could craft a soul from any of the primal forces creating an arcane soul or a soul of light, while they fundamentally work differently and some scholars may argue with you it is life. Anything you craft will be unfalteringly loyal to you, obeying any order or command you have never trying to betray you. While this is happily and willingly desired by things you create from scratch or imbue with its first wil., the resurrected may only be begrudgingly held to this standard. This specialty applies to anything you can create not just life. No sword you forged could ever harm you unless you wanted it to and if it was a living weapon it may even slice it own wielders throat if they tried to use it against you. You may put limitations on wielders like Odin did with Mjolnir. You are now a font of Light, you may wield and imbue light into all your magic and crafts, while not infinite or even at the level of a Na'ru the light in you will continue to grow and will eventually allow for true light forging. \n You May Choose: Paladin",

        "Description": "Shaper of Worlds: Your skills in the crafting of objects, buildings, and landscapes grants you the ability to forge artifacts and legendary equipment with ease, your crafting capabilities being an order of magnitude greater than they would have been without this focus. You have the ability to craft landscapes, you can easily shape mountains, valleys, rivers and seas to your liking in minutes enriching the earth and sky with magic to amplify and encourage or discourage the flourishing of life or specific species. Everything you build is a masterful work of art, both beautiful and functional beyond compare. The things you create being sturdier and nearly indestructible fighting off the weathering of time and the environment even without the use of magic, a painting you made could be lost in an acid swamp for millennia and barely need a light dusting and drying to make it presentable. You also have an intuitive sense of any crafts you come across instinctively knowing what it once was no matter how rundown it is, even a small shred of a few strands of a quilt would do, having visions of and knowing its full purpose, intent, and how it was used; you have the ability to understand the original creators design and how to improve it both functionally and artistically. Anything you restore qualifies as being crafted by you for the purposes of any effects you have, including your preservation skills and quality skills. Anything you are actively crafting, have crafted, or in charge of can be preserved by your will and an occasional thought, this being an active force protected against harm, decay and entropy. Only beings who directly intend to harm you or the things you have crafted or preserved can hope to damage them and even still such damage is lessened, and you will be able to restore such things later. You may repair and restore things to exactly as they were or an improved state up to your level of crafting; your powers of preservation and restoration can apply to non-crafted things that you watch over such as the environment, climate, weather, and enchantments. \n You May Choose: Hunter \n Enhanced: You may now craft impossibilities into your lands, cut a mountain or raise a continent into the sky where it will stay, imbue the land with the ability to fight back and defend itself against invaders, build world machines and city forges to aid in the creation of anything you can imagine. Your crafts are as immortal and timeless as yourself, nearly impervious to outside forces. You can build temples to enhance the gather of worship and various types of energy, forge and craft mega structures like sky elevators and dyson spheres, even artificial suns and black holes are within your grasp as long as you have the materials and magics. The prisons you build could trap old gods, multidimensional beings, eldrazi, or the like forever this extends to the point of beings that aren't just stronger than you but god like in their strength to you. You could build a tomb to imprison Sargeras till the end of time long after the heat death of the universe and your prison will still stand. Whatever you build will function as intended no matter how impractical the design is. This comes with the added ability of being able to force higher dimensional beings or entities from other realms into whatever realm you are crafting in. That ghost who can phase through solid objects can't phase through your bricks, or fist, unless you allow it. This comes with more esoteric capabilities like building rivers out of fire, mountains out of smoke, a living tree out of feathers and glass that is still capable of photosynthesis. Your alchemical capabilities are to the point you can not only transmute metals to stone, or vise versa, you could transmute things into organic materials of your liking or something between organic, inorganic, energy, and dreams. You are now a font, well, and battery of Arcane. Short of the titans themselves you are the strongest source of arcane energy. Arcane energy flows from you with ease allowing you to supply this power to whatever you like. \n You May choose: Monk",

        "Description": "The titanic-watchers, first of the titan-forged, their bodies were hand crafted by the Pantheon from the material surface of Azeroth before being brought to life by a great infusion of arcane and spirit. Designed to act as a medium between the Pantheon and Azeroth, flesh from one, mind and soul from the other. Traits - All titanic-watchers are immensely powerful beings, expert craftsmen, and masterful warriors wielding magics and skills for the purpose of destroying the old gods, taming the elementals, and ordering worlds from chaos. You must choose whether you are of the stone crafted Vanir or the metal crafted Aesir. The Vanir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from stone with command over the powers of the earth and fire. The Aesir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from metal with command over the powers of storms, wind, and lightning. While all titanic-watchers are already more skilled than even the greatest of mortals dare to dream, all titanic-watchers have specialties. You may choose Warrior or Mage as a class, and you choose one of the following specialties: \n Weaver of Dreams: You have the ability to design new spells from scratch if need be, but you have an intrinsic understanding of all forms of magic or spells you come across. While you might not have enough power to actually wield those forces you will absolutely understand them. But what good is knowledge if you can't do anything with it? You laugh at such notions as you can always find a way to improve any magic, making any given spell, enchantment, or ritual more versatility, faster to cast, faster to recover, require less mana or resources, stronger, and increasing the duration; basically, any means by which a spell or enchantment could be improved is improved by double or half as appropriate. But you do not simply cast spells, you craft magic itself, from arcane sources, wielding forces beyond compare, making new spells, enchantments, and rituals as needed. Even on the fly, with comparative capabilities of other magics within that area, your improvisational magic is inspired and artistic in the extreme allowing you to incorporate any kinds of themes for your magics or supernatural abilities. As you are wielding the raw craft of the arcane itself, your spells cannot be countered unless the counter would negate magic itself (a counter fireball or counter any fire magic spell would not work against your fireball, they would have to have a counter for any magic spell, anti-magic effect.) Your magic is more resilient and more easily bypasses defenses, your enchantments take on a life of their own as you are able to weave enchantments into intrinsic natures to create wonders of spell craft such as true alchemy creating new substances, pocket dimensions, magical terrains and sacred places on the order of mythals, legendary spells, and magical items akin to artifacts, and mythical charms. Your magical strength and reserves are increased by an order of magnitude , and this specialty implies to any kinds of magic or similar supernatural abilities you have such as divinity or psionics. \n You May Choose: Druid \n Enhanced: You can weave magic into intricate reality so as to define the laws and natures of the world it's in and create spaces, realms, and dimensions that overlap with each other. With enough arcane energy magic can even be used to create realities and dreams that are interchangeable making something real into a dream or something that was once a dream into real thereby granting you the ability to craft matter and dreams themselves. Creating something like the Emerald Dream, for the dreams of life and world, or even the shadowlands, for the souls of the dead, would be easy for someone like you, if not time consuming, It took Freya a few thousand years to complete the emerald dream, which still required regular maintenance, preservation, and protection. Not only are you able to create new realms, you can freely travel worlds and sub-planes such as the old planes of the dream or the emerald nightmare. You can build gates to other worlds and planes or simply travel there directly, you can enter the spaces between spaces or even make them yourself. You have an intrinsic understanding of your place in the world and where to find things, lost or known, physical, ephemeral, or even knowledge. You are never lost, can easily find your way home or through any maze or labyrinth uncover all its secrets like child's play. And if someone ever does try to trap or endanger you you may simply step back into one of the realms you've made from anywhere. You have also become a font, or well, and battery of Life and spirit able to wield not only arcane magics, but druidic and shamanic ones as well, imbuing it into your craft. Your spirit energy and life force will continue to grow, which can be enhanced by proper usage of your realms and enchantments. \n You May Choose: Shaman \n While your abilities and skills are far more vast, varied, and greater than any other races, besides your makers, your power is not. You are stronger than any normal dragon, but the dragon aspects outclass you, it would take dozens of you to kill an elemental lord, and a small army of you may not succeed in defeating an old god let alone killing one. However, for an additional 500 cp you will be a Keeper, personally chosen out of the army of titanic-watchers, imbued with strength beyond compare. Your power is so great that many of the lesser races worship you as a god. Two Keepers working together could kill an elemental lord with relative ease, and a keeper with a small squadron of titanic-watchers could defeat and capture an old god. You may choose one of the following: You gain a second specialization blending them so that both specialization's traits apply to all aspects of the other specialization , or you may gain an unmatched level of combat experience removing the restrictions on your class - any class or profession you gain you become the paragon of that class outmatching anyone with that same class as you to the point of being able to hit one level above your weight/power class with ease you can pick one extra class for free. Either way the strength of all your specializations are doubled and you gain Enhanced capabilities with them. You will be a leader and a tactician capable of organizing thousands upon thousands of people with ease to accomplish specific goals such as war, combating poverty, or finding a cure for a disease. People will be more likely to help you than not, even if they have nothing in particular to gain. Any companions, followers, friends, organizations, and family you had before find their loyalty towards you increased. Things that are a direct benefit to you are guaranteed to have any organizations you control work their hardest to see you succeed.",

Many techniques that were once burned away by She Who Lives in Her Name have been rediscovered. Foremost in these are the techniques to allow demons to build structures that do not need pillars, arches and other support structures. Buildings hundreds if not thousands of feet high can be built without any apparent load-bearing walls or struts. Windows and doors can be placed anywhere without disrupting the integrity of a building. \n Of course these techniques work best with the brass and black stone common to Malfeas, even if they work to a lesser extent with other materials. So it is just one more reason most buildings in Malfeas are made of brass and basalt, along with their abundant presence. Yet many more techniques are used by the artisans and architects of Malfeas, even aside from the omnipresent murals, wall carvings, and other ornamentations. \n Techniques to create such marvels as buildings that sprout from the ground at unnatural angles and made of polished brass turned a rainbow of colors by a process known only to the most skilled of architects. In many of these techniques you have gained the pinnacle of skill and knowledge, that you might replicate the Demon City's constructions even in other realms. While you might not have reliable access to the materials common to those in hell, you will be able to substitute many other materials for these in your structures. And as a truly talented architect you will find the design and construction of Manses comes just as easily to you, even gleaning some additional power from the conflux of essence it is build upon if you do use these hellish methods.",

Hunter's Tools are usually supernatural items that have been made to work using a Blood/Quicksilver Bullet medium, such as the Beast Roar, a beast's claw that when activated, allows the wielder to roar like a beast. \n Some Hunter's Tools are completely man made as well, though this is a relative minority.

The mice around Gnawnia are simple critters, and even a simple mallet trap would work against them. But then the problem was suppressed, and hunters began moving to different regions. This led to them encountering mice for which the traditional mousetrap was utterly ineffective, marking the beginning of an arms race with no apparent end. \n Whether you're working on a project for a friend or for personal use, this allows you to modify a very specific property, the power type. Seen as an elemental affinity of sorts, this property is key to making tools effective under a wide range of circumstances. The traditional Physical trap doesn't do all that well against ghostly entities, but Shadow traps tend to work well. Arcane traps excel against magical entities, but certain mice are too strategically minded that they specifically require Tactical traps in order to be bested. \n There are nine different power types which can be cycled through. Physical, Tactical, Shadow, Arcane, Hydro, Forgotten, Draconic, Parental, Law and Rift. Most of these are rather straightforward except for the extremely esoteric ones like Forgotten (intended for eldritch entities... like the Old One Mice), Law (intended for criminals and outlaws) and Parental (intended for effectively anything that isn't an adult). It's important to note that this modification is more akin to an addition rather than a replacement. Existing elemental affinities on the target item are unaffected by this.

You can build things like buildings that are much bigger on the inside than their exterior would suggest, tunnels and halls that cross continents, even a series of connected spaces that randomly move you between them whenever you enter a door. The limiting factor is that you'd need to spend the same amount of resources as constructing the actual structure would be, although thankfully you won't need to spend as much time; a bigger on the inside house would use the amount of materials that the bigger insides suggest, for example. In addition, your twisted mind helps protect from mind reading, as your mind is as labyrinthine as your creations.",

This also applies to your raw skills, allowing you to use skills in one crafting/creative discipline for other areas of work.

The numbers are not low, requiring a large amount of people to play for extended amounts of time before your world begins to go from unreal to real. A minimum of 200,000 souls all playing in your world all believing in it and wishing it was real will be your lower threshold for such a feat, that is your minimum threshold to start an unreal world down its path become a real world of its own.

A few hours is usually all it takes but already powerful items can take expensive, rare or dangerous to acquire materials to remake. More uniquely, your revision ability allows you to alter these catalysts. Again, basing the extent of the effect on time and resources, but you can certainly make a magical sword several times as powerful or add numerous new abilities to it, altering it's history or composition so that it always had those qualities. \n Perhaps a cart of raw materials from the local town square is all it'd take to take an ordinary iron blade and make it sharp enough to cut metal and alight in flame on command. But improving an already legendary blade like Durandal even moderately could take fortune's worth of materials that would already be difficult to attain, even for a king. There is not technically a limit on how far an object may be revised, though the cost of doing so will continue to grow greatly.

First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking. \n Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith's hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords.

Years of experience in folding paper has certainly made you a master at creating even the most complex origami shapes, your skill growing to the point that it began to mix with your magical energy, turning into something much more dangerous. You can easily use magic to shape paper into a wide variety of forms, imbued with varying effects. Creating origami familiars from paper, dangerous enough to scythe through human soldiers, is a ground-level effect. Creating powerful shields from overlapping paper flowers, flight through origami wings, patterns that strengthen existing spells or apply curse-like debuffs to those pierced by the paper cranes are all possible. While your main skill lies with direct paper spells, you will also find it much more possible to place magical effects onto paper for use with your magic.

Smaller, less powerful crystals are occasionally used as well, both as “Magic Relay” structures at fixed locations and with special equipment used by champions of the various armies. You are a gifted artificer when it comes to creating such relays and projectors. Not only can you create such crystals, but you have mastered the magical theories behind their function to the point you could craft these magical artifacts from other materials such as wood or silver. As your skill increases you'll be able to create more intricate and efficient relays, reducing their size or increasing their range. With practice, you could craft gemstones small enough for a ring's jewel that could let you project your magic within a dozen miles of their location. Once attuned, the connection between a Wizard and the relays you craft cannot be broken, it will continue to function across any distance and even across dimensions so long as the relay remains intact.",

        "Cost": 200,
        "Description": "Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifice, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. The Key of Artifice allows liches who practice it to form a sort of reserve of artifice energy inside themselves that they can invest into items to create various Arcane tools. The amount of energy they can invest grows with each rank, but is fixed. They must recover the invested Artifice energy if they want to reinvest it in a new item. Normally it's somewhat annoying to reclaim energy from an item you don't have control of, but because you bought it as a perk, you may freely reclaim it at any time. Actually investing Artifice energy requires enchantment work and spending three parts Arcane energy for every bit of Artifice invested. A lich gains the ability to make items in this order - \n Arcane Focus: An Arcane Focus can have a number of abilities depending on the amount of Artifice invested in it, and how those points are invested. Only the Lich who makes it can use it. It can store Arcane, though it's not as efficient as an Arcane Crystal. It can be made to regenerate Arcane on its own for a somewhat high cost in Artifice. It can be made into a tool that can hold spells for you. It can make your spells deal greater damage. It can make it easier to use Sorcerae. It can help maintain Arcana for you with a phantom mind. It can help protect you from the threat of insanity from overusing Arcana - though unless you take certain disadvantages, you're already protected. It can have any other reasonable power that is in line with these. \n Arcane Crystal: These crystals can hold Arcane Energy, and are easy to move energy into and out of. No other function, but they are more cost effective for the amount stored then a Focus. They're made from precious gems, with the more precious the gem, the better a focus it can make. A simple one is in the 10 gp range, while the greatest ones are crystals worth 500 gp. Since you purchased this perk, it's possible for you to potentially use exotic / rarer / more expensive gems, but such would require research on your part. \n Occularum: An Occularum is a kind of immaterial drone used as a spy or seeker. Appearing as inky globes of misty darkness about two feet across, their shape seems to hint at being a giant eye. They usually remain on the Spectral Plane, only called when needed. Even when called forth, they are immaterial presences, hiding in the folds between the Material and the Spectral plane. Made of the substance of thought and imagination, they can slip through the tiniest crack even in substances that can block the immaterial. They can't really be damaged, though they can be stopped by forces that guard against immaterial and extra-dimensional intrusions. While on the Material Plane, it will see into both the Material and Spectral planes at the same time. It can clearly see for a mile on the Material, though it has ten times the range of vision on the Spectral plane. It has all the same vision modes you have, and you can use any spell to detect or see things through it. They always have Darkvision, Arcane Sight, and Detect Magic active. Your Arcane rank determines how well they can perceive and notice things, with the higher your rank the better their perception, easily reaching into the superhuman range by the 2nd or 3rd rank. They fly at about twice the speed of a normal human running, with perfect mobility. They require a moderate amount of Arcane to create, and no investment of your Artifice potential. You can have a number of them in existence at the same time based on your Intelligence. You can call one down anywhere on the same plane of existence as you, though you need some way of targeting the landing, of which you know several methods. Finally they can follow simple instructions on their own, and can “contact” you for clarification, or you can actively control them, and they're well suited to searches or as sentinels. \n Greater Phylactery: An Arcane Lich who has achieved the penultimate technique of Artifice can create a Bound Phylactery, a greater form of Phylactery. There are many advantages to a Greater Phylactery. The first advantage is that they are far tougher than a normal Phylactery. You are always aware of where it is, as long as it's on the same plane as you. If it isn't, you're aware of what plane it is on. You always know when it's been touched by another being, and when it's taken damage. You can spend a trivial amount of Arcane to see the area around your Phylactery, and maintain that vision as long as you concentrate. Your Phylactery can also store up to six motes of Arcane energy, and regenerates a single one each day. You must be able to touch it to draw on that Arcane. You may also set up to six spells upon your Phylactery to trigger on contingencies you define. If they activate dangerous damaging spells, your Phylactery won't be harmed. You can hang six spells inside your Phylactery to draw upon when you need them. You don't need to be touching it to draw upon them, but it does take a moment of concentration. Creating a Greater Phylactery ties up an entire Rank's worth of Artifice Points. \n Bound Phylactery: The most ambitious liches won't be satisfied with a “mere” Greater Phylactery. A bound phylactery isn't an object, it's a place. A house on chicken legs, an undersea palace of impossible geometries, a mountain. It takes physical work through the entire structure to be bound, and an investment of resources directly proportional to the volume being bound, but there is no limit on size. In return, a Lich can bind themselves to something that isn't carried so much as lived within. Here are some common properties that show up in most Bound Phylacteries.\n&emsp;• You can see from anywhere on or in it, as if you were standing there.\n&emsp;• You can teleport to any part of it for a modest cost in Arcane. You can be perfectly accurate with the spell as long as the destination is within or on it.\n&emsp;• You can cast spells through it, as if you were there.\n&emsp;• You can manipulate space and dimensions inside and around it.\n&emsp;• You can make it shift and cause parts of it to move. If it's built correctly, you can make it walk la Baba Yaga's hut or Howl's Moving Castle.\n&emsp;• You know everyone who is in contact with it, and where they are.\n&emsp;• It regenerates at 5% of its total “health” per day if damaged, and you can speed it up massively by meditating on making it fix itself. \n Bound Phylacteries are grand works of Artifice, and they tend to have unique properties in addition to these. It binds two whole ranks worth of Artifice points to make a Bound Phylactery. In addition to those more permanent constructions, Liches with the Arcana of Artifice also learn the technique of Arcane Enhancement. This essentially lets the lich turn prepared objects into enchanted objects with a temporary enhancement based on your Arcane State. As you bought this as a perk, you can always treat it as the final Arcane state (Spectral Lich), for an enhancement bonus of six on the item. You don't have to use the full bonus, as the higher bonus you use the more expensive in Arcane it gets. Such tools are Arcane weapons or armor. The Arcane Trait makes them especially good against the forces of the Void. In future worlds, it will work against forces of unmaking, oblivion, and the like, as well as undead in general. Weapons with the Arcane trait ignore defenses and immunities. Armor is stronger and helps you resist magical attacks. Other items are harder for forces of the void to resist. Who knows what incredible things you'll to make as your mastery of Artifice continues to grow?",

        "Description": "While every artificer will continue to grow in the amount of Artifice they can keep invested, your growth is doubled here. More than that, you find you can permanently empower things, freeing you from having to maintain an ongoing investment. It takes a fifty-to-one ratio of Arcane to Artifice to replace the Artifice investment, and you can't empower something beyond your theoretical maximum Artifice - how much you could invest if all of it was available for you to use at one time. Using this, it's possible to make Arcane Foci that other people can use. As long as all the investment is permanent investment paid in Arcane, then you can set criteria for who or what can use it. Note that there aren't a lot of limits on what an Arcane Foci can do. You can also make an Arcane Enhancement permanent. It requires ten times as much Arcane to make it permanent as temporary. Such enhancement overlaps with standard enchantment, but does count as the required “+1” needed before other special abilities might be added, and an item so enhanced is considered an Arcane Enchantment for the purposes of ignoring anti-magic and spells. Yes, you can make an item a permanent Arcana Foci with interesting abilities, make it permanently Arcane Enhanced, and then enchant it. Something like that is basically a minor artifact though, and represents a huge investment of time and effort, without other perks.",

Golems are a common tool for the Liches of the Guild of Wizards. The greatest are the semi-real Artifex Golems of the Order of Artifex, but making them is hardly limited to just those master craftsman. The common Arcane Golem is created from a Heart. These Golem Hearts are crafted from precious stones and metals, growing increasingly grand for more impressive Golem Hearts, and then they're empowered with an investment of energy. A lich may temporarily invest part of their Permanent Arcane, tying it up in the empowerment of the heart. They can reclaim that investment at any time, but the heart will break and must be crafted anew. Alternatively, if the Lich also practices the Arcana of Artifice, they may instead invest Artifice into empowering a Heart. \n A lich may only have a limited number of hearts in existence at once, restricted by the height of their Intelligence. Once empowered, a golem heart is very similar to a Occularum, though unlike those devices it has no sense of its own. Instead, it can bind its now immaterial essence to a piece of the world, and reshape that piece into a Golem. Such crude golems might be relatively weak on their own, but can channel a shadow of their makers might and skill. If destroyed, the Heart is dissipated from reality into potentiality for a time, but will reform after a day. It's also possible to build prepared vessels for the Golem Heart. Such vessels are far stronger than an ad-hoc animation, and the destruction of such a vessel will not dissipate the Golem Heart, letting it jump to a new vessel immediately. That strength though comes at the cost of, well, cost. Resources and time and effort to craft such. A Crystal Golem for example may be a juggernaut, but it's also a ten foot tall statue made of diamond and platinum. Making it costs. Obviously you are not limited to just Crystal Golems, and can use other materials you have access to, with more powerful and exotic materials tending to result in more powerful and exotic golems. With effort even things like the mighty and near indestructible Adamantium Golem may be in your reach. You may see out of the eyes of your Golems (or roughly where their head is, should they not have eyes), and project your mind into them to control them directly. They can obey simple orders and routines, and make fine guards and wardens, if unimaginative ones.",

In the end, they're surprisingly good at working around their limitations. They also reform in only six hours, and they're better at animating their bodies than normal golem hearts. They might have the same basic attributes, but their reflexes and skill at using those attributes is improved. Occularum abilities are described in the Key Of Artifice perk.

Still, many young Lunars find they will have to create their own panoplies, for their elders often hoard these artifacts to themselves. It is a good thing then, that you are an exceptionally talented artisan, a master in all the mundane crafts and even further genius at working the mercurial Moonsilver that responds best to you. You have been granted the secrets of creating artifacts from that changeable metal, as well as how to make mundane armor into the Moon-Faced Mail that likewise shifts to fit whatever form you are currently wearing. Even the most important technique of the No Moons is known to you, the Form-Fixing Method that binds the moonsilver tattoos to the body of newly reincarnated Lunars.",

Through her own expertise, Noellia altered it into a tool for communication, hypnosis, and performing all kinds of rituals. While you might not necessarily have something worthy of your skills to use, you too have reached this level of prowess. Altering magical items to perform completely different functions is something you could do if given a mere month or two to study them. Simple tweaks, such as removing a fire scepter's ability to create fire to augment its ability to command fire, would require seconds at most. Actually improving an item is a lot more involved, and could take years of work to see any noticeable change, but is well within your capabilities, as is reverse engineering them outright.",

You understand just how powerful and important such tools can be, for you yourself are a skilled and talented enchanter. You find that imbuing items with powers is a simple matter for you, overlaying nearly any spell or magical ability you know onto some item to more easily invoke it yourself or even to allow others to do so. Though you are not yet as skilled in the creation of such wonders as Agomotto, this may yet change in time.

As a Player you have hit level 100, not exactly a surprise since most Players had done that, and represent the absolute peak of personal power and ability. If you're a Local then you're quite frankly a freak of nature and are probably seen as a god by any other locals that actually know what you're really capable of. Literally, by the way, the Slane Theocracy actually worships as gods a group of six level one hundred Players that appeared to them in the past, though virtually no one still alive outside the highest echelons of the Theocracy itself actually knows that. All level one hundred individuals possess high-tier nullification defensive abilities. This means that individuals won't be able to even hurt you that aren't, at the very least, within the fabled “Realm of Heroes” and even then they'd have to be a hero among heroes to manage it, and they'd still have to get past your normal defenses even if they manage that much. The only hope they'd normally have is if they possessed access to some magical artifact of sufficient power to get past your defenses. That said the high-tier nullification is an all or nothing ability, either it works or it doesn't. \n Your physical and magical statistics are absolutely mind boggling as far as the locals are concerned. Even magic casters, if they're level one hundred, will possess physical strength and defenses on par with a warrior that is “only” in the “Realm of Heroes”, and warriors can expect to be far far beyond even that. Magic casters actual magic power is enough that it could literally bring even the greatest human archmage to his knees in awe and shame at his own weakness, were he to actually witness your true strength. Even warriors that only dabbled in magic would still be on par with magic casters in the “Realm of Heroes” at the very least. The abilities of a Generalist, both physical and magical, will outstrip everyone other than their level 100 peers by a tremendous degree. \n As a warrior you are capable of annihilating armies of tens of thousands of regular men on your own, and likely wouldn't even notice them. It would take legendary heroes or beasts to actually make you break your stride. You'll possess skills that will let you nullify certain damage types outright, perform swings of your weapon that can hit dozens of individuals at once with air pressure alone, and provide you with a myriad of defenses against magic casters that would seek to stymie you and prevent you from closing the distance. You are literally a one-man army killing machine. As a Warrior you additionally possess “super moves” that can do things like grant temporary invulnerability to virtually anything, allow you to strike everything in your line of sight with a single powerful blow at the same time, or hit one opponent dozens of times with a single strike. \n As a magic caster you are capable of casting spells of every tier up to the 10th Tier. This is a tier of magic that only a bare handful of people in the entire world even know exists, with most believing that 7th tier is as high as it goes. 10th Tier magic is the stuff of legends, capable of healing armies or slaying them, resurrecting the dead en mass, permanent teleportation circles, “buffing” or “debuffing” entire armies, summoning forth creatures of legend as servitors, and so forth. As a Magic Caster you'll also be capable of “Over-rank Magic”, also known as Super-tier magic, that exceeds even that. Singular spells that could slay 70,000 men in one go and then also summon massively powerful eldritch nightmares under your command at the same time, destroying entire cities with rain that infects those it falls upon with an undead plague, conjuring forth miles upon miles of enchanted forest that responds to your will and will empower you while you are within, or spells of similar such scale and effect. Unlike normal spells “over-rank” spells don't actually cost mana and are more akin to skills, they always have a long casting time, usually a minute or so, and you must stand still and can not do anything else while casting them. Additionally you can only use them a few times per day. \n If you are a Generalist there really isn't a question of “can you do something” so much as “how do you do it today, and will you do it differently tomorrow”. You're not quite on the same tier of skill as the warrior at combat, or the magic caster at magic, but you're just below both of them. Magic of the 9th tier is yours to command, and while you're not the combat beast a warrior could be you find that your command of both the physical and magical aspects give you a range of utility and versatility no one else could boast. As a Generalist you don't benefit from super moves or over-rank magic but in compensation your statistics are significantly better overall in the areas where the other origins would be weak. You do have one area however where you particularly shine. You are blisteringly fast. You could run circles around the warrior even if you couldn't beat him at swordplay, and you can certainly close the distance (or run away) from a magic caster in the blink of an eye. You've also picked up a penchant for sneak attacks, and opponents that don't see you coming rarely get the opportunity to learn from that mistake.",

You have the knowledge to twist a humans form into a variety of shapes with Hemalurgy, creating entirely new creatures formed from the hemalurgic charge in the spike and the recipient's own soul. This process usually requires multiple spikes, and twisting a human too far from their natural form can destroy their mind. The more a person is twisted in this fashion, the more powerful the charge in their spikes becomes, enhancing whatever abilities they gain from it. You also gain the ability to find the bind points in any nonhuman creature. Creatures that are largely humanoid only take a few minutes of visual inspection animals can take hours of intensive study. Sufficiently bizarre creatures may require days or weeks, and you may need to perform vivisection or other intrusive and indepth analysis in order fully map the creature's bind points. As a side benefit, hemalurgic spikes you make are more efficient, storing greater chargers and degrading slower than normal. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane. Furthermore, attempting to use this ability without A Messy Process results in having very little control over the exact mutations your subject manifests.

Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you've taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset. \n First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it's something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it. \n The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you'd be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection. \n But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there's no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create.",

Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own. \n By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source. \n From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers. \n Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully. \n There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly.

The amount of crystals you need for the process is substantial - but the magic is ultimately necessary, so that you don't leave a single imperfection which may ruin the final product, and also so that it doesn't end up looking bulky and cumbersome. \n Objects that you craft with the same principle exhibit durability several times stronger than what you would have expected from an equivalent of similar weight.",

There's no need to sharpen it, but what about its inherent qualities? You know that magic enchantment on it? Or that spell it seems to cast every once in a while? Our form of blacksmithing works on those innate properties and spells instead. We don't strengthen the exterior; we strengthen what's inside, and bring the potential of that weapon up even higher. That low-level ice spell your sword casts? Yeah, let's work at it until it casts a stream of frost. It's going to take a while, but anything worth doing is going to take time.

Now that's no longer a problem. An absolute resistance to magic is now nothing before you. Your spells and magical items do damage like they weren't even there to begin with, and that's if they had a full immunity.

Colonists isolated by lightyears from their nearest neighbors must be ready to handle any failure of their machines, so reliable, low technology is usually more common than quickmatter and full automation. Yet when it comes to merging the two, you have a fascinating ability to keep high-technology devices running by replacing failing systems with low-tech equivalents. Where a space station might have used superconductor radiator panels to manage temperature, you could find a way to replace them with steam cooling; when your shuttles run out of antimatter, you'll find it easy to replace those drives with a fusion torch or even chemical rockets. At the extreme limits of your ability, you might replace a simple but essential computer with a mechanical calculator, crunching out numbers with cogs, punch cards and levers.",

You can “destructively research” a given item in your inventory or that you can and are holding entirely in your hands, and once you have researched enough of them, you will be able to instantly duplicate said item. However, you aren't able to simply duplicate it for free. Instead, you can sacrifice additional items to build up a reservoir of “material” that can then be used to create duplicates. Rarer items provide more material, with the amount needed to research a given item being a general baseline. So, if it took 100 items to research one item, and only 1 item to research another, then you would have to sacrifice 100 more of the first item to make one duplicate of the second. A second change is that the number of items that must be researched has been increased. Items that normally might have only taken 1 item to research now need 3 or more, and an item that might have normally taken 10 could take 40 or 50. CP-Backed items can be researched, but their duplicates won't have their CP-backed powers, only the default powers of whatever type of item they are.

This ability allows, with enough time and research invested, to create substances that mimic those found in nature, albeit manufactured artificially. While these new artificial substances do not surpass the original, it can for all purposes be substituted by it with no drawbacks. However, the material must still be manufactured - but, once the process is known, other factions, civilizations, and individuals, by following the process, can also create the artificial material. This ability works post-jump, even for materials that do not naturally occur in the new universe.",

You can address this problem during the production cycle by manipulating the size of your creation: making it twice as large or half as large, whichever is most appropriate. \n Creations made this way do not require extra resources or additional tuning to function, and they'll function just as well with the size taken into consideration.",
