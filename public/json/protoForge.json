Because the Andromeda Initiative knew that they’d be going with a finite supply of ammo, medi-gel and power cells, each omni-tool can recover and repurpose appropriate resources to serve appropriate functions. For example, liquid coolant allows weapon heatsinks to be reused, and organic compounds can be refined into medi-gel. They can also convert consumable items into immediately usable forms. Finally, they do everything else regular omni-tools can: Communication, manufacturing fabricator, sensor analysis, and computer mainframe.\n   2. Scanner [100CP]\nThis omni-tool mounted system is how the Andromeda Initiative plans to rapidly survey planets. This system is a fast and accurate sampling system that is formally known as Panoptes. When linked to an AI, it can produce multiple analyses and predictive models in seconds, turning what would be the surveying work of weeks into mere moments. For most purposes it uses a transmitted accelerator mass spectrometer to create a “snapshot” of an objects components, atomic weight, and radioactivity, allowing for in-depth analysis. For biological materials, the system switches to an electrospray ionization system, so that plants or animals can be scanned without causing radiation damage. For a Jumper, you no longer need to have an AI linked to the system for it to work, though that would help. You can also take DNA scans of organisms for further study, and scan devices to help you figure out what they do, and maybe later reproduce them. Lastly, if you have a longer ranged sensor system, you could link the Scanner to that to scan further away, even if being in the Scanner’s original range would get you clearer results."

In an attempt to mitigate this, the melting pot was constructed with a higher rate of mixing. This directly translates to a higher degree of homogenization, but you’ll have to understand that to maintain this level of mixing you need to have a higher energy source than just a fire under the cauldron. It does allow you to blend some ingredients that normally would not mix however, though the results may still not be as optimal as you would hope. \n   3.

Hunter's Tools are usually supernatural items that have been made to work using a Blood/Quicksilver Bullet medium, such as the Beast Roar, a beast's claw that when activated, allows the wielder to roar like a beast. Some Hunter's Tools are completely manmade as well, though this is a relative minority. Basically, you now know how to convert things into being activated and powered by Blood Bullets and Quicksilver Bullets. Doing so allows anyone to use them, even if they are completely mundane beings, so long as they have the bullets mentioned above on their person. When making Hunter's Tools, remember that the more power something requires, the bullets the wielder will need. These skills granted to you may be honed over time, just as any other skill can."

Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own. By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source. From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers. Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully. There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in."

Harmeless Extraction [200CP]\nWith hempen yarn and animal skins in shorter supply since the catastrophe, you and other craftsman have had to adapt your practices in order to keep the orders met. Practices to minimize the amount of animals killed, to make the most out of that which you have on hand are all crucial nowadays as resources grow scarcer. While the animals still aren't too comfortable with it, with this magic you can weave together a copy of their skin or wool, while only taking a small portion of what they have. It doesn't really feel right, but at least the animal is still alive! It’ll take time, but what you’ve taken will slowly grow back.\n   3. Rapid Growth [200CP]\nYou can't afford to wait years for a forest to regrow! By the time that forest grows to a state where it's ready for harvest, you won't even need the lumber to build your house anymore! No, in order to make it in time for harvest this season, you're going to need to draw on some more potent forces.It might be a little bit dangerous to use Aether in such a fashion, but by imbuing the saplings with concentrated Aether, you've successfully sped up the growth rate of the trees -to a point where you can harvest them again. Well, unfortunately, the trees did grow a bit bigger than normal, but you expect that's just a normal side effect from using concentrated Aether to grow things."

Artificial Alloys [600CP]\n Naturally occurring substances can offer a good start point for the development of new and innovative machinery and technology. However, often times these natural resources have limitations - whether it be rarity, difficulty of acquisition, and so on. In such cases, science steps to the fore, fashioning new materials unseen by nature to do that which mother nature started. This ability allows, with enough time and research invested, to create substances that mimic those found in nature, albeit manufactured artificially. While this new artificial substances do not surpass the original, it can for all purposes be substituted by it with no drawbacks. However, the material must still be manufactured - but, once the process is known, other factions, civilizations, and individuals, by following the process, can also create the artificial material. This ability works post-jump, even for materials that do not naturally occur in the new universe."

A machine that generates a static field to generate an electric shock attack is the same as a lightning bolt spell. With this perk, you can comprehend the link that exists between Science and Magic, and with the proper time and resources reproduce a piece of technology as a magical spell or reproduce a magical effect as a piece of technology. For example, you could take a lightbulb, analyze it, understand how it works in its  entirety, then create a magical spell that produces the same amount of light when an equivalent amount of magical power is fed into it. There are a few caveats here, however. First, you must be capable of already replicating the magical effect, spell, or piece of technology on your own, as this power only lets you reproduce a magical or technological effect in its  equivalent technological or magical form. If you weren't able to reproduce a magical effect using magic or a technological effect using technology in the first place, this perk will not let you reproduce them in the opposite manner now. Comprehension alone won't cut it, the ability to already reproduce the effects is necessary. Second, complexity of the magic or technology you wish to reproduce a converted equivalent of is conserved across systems, so the amount of time necessary to reproduce the equivalent in the opposing system will be, at minimum, the same amount of time it would take to reproduce the equivalent in the same system. A highly sophisticated though reproducible multi-layered magic construct or spell will result in an equally complex technological creation that will be equally or more difficult to understand, use, and replicate. Third, the limitations of the magic or technology are carried over. If you were incapable of using a piece of tech or magic, you will be incapable of using its equivalent. A spell that creates an Elemental without true sentience will not create a thinking, self-upgrading AI in its technological equivalent, though reproducing an AI as a magic construct or a self-aware thinking magical construct as a technological entity WILL. If a magical entity or technological construct has a soul, so would its equivalent, but you would already have to be capable of reproducing said soul in the original system. And fourth, converted technology or magic that you give to others will function only if both A:Either you or them (Doesn't have to be both) would be capable of using the original magic or technology, and B: That if a piece of magic or tech requires energy to function, then an appropriate amount of energy is provided to fuel the magic or tech. Draw off a battery or mana capacitor, have it draw off the person's own mana reserves if they have them, have it draw off ambient energy in the air. One way or another, an amount of energy equivalent to the original power requirements must be supplied"

Handy if you want to duplicate your brain, or something too large to fit. In general, if alchemizing something is possible, you'll be able to think of way to do it."

		"description":"At its most basic, alchemy is simply the creation of magic concoctions and items with a range of effects, from the mundane, such as healing items and exploding liquids, to the horrifying and illegal, such as the much feared Ghoul Powder that turns the living into mindless demons. From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy."

		"description":"Alchemy is the ancient art of drawing power from mystic artifacts. Unlike some variations of it you may have seen already, its core principle is imbuement and extraction. First, one must select an object with a useful quality, then they must understand this object fully through study. Then, through this understanding, one may refine this quality into a free-floating concept. This concept may then be applied to a useful vessel, which will benefit from such. For example, one may learn all that there is about a fighter jet, to the point of being capable of explaining everything about it and its operation and function with absolute certainty no matter what circumstances befall it. Then, one may reduce this particular jet to its Flight alone. One could then add its Flight to a suit of armor. An alchemist could then tap into the concept of Flight within it to soar. One could do the same to an industrial electromagnetic order to acquire the concept of Magnetic Attraction, or even a living being in order to acquire the concept of Self-Replication. However, one may only bind two concepts to any given object, and they may not be removed once set."

Combining your transmutation skills with these exotic and vastly expensive forms of matter, you’ll be able to produce Alchemical Chests with incredible volume, indestructible equipment with immense power, energy collector systems to generate additional resources from nothingness, and potentially become nearly immortal, burning vast quantities of resources instead of taking wounds. Your powers are all incredibly expensive to use, and you won’t be able to max them out in your time here (especially if you don’t have any advantages in harvesting resources!), but the raw potential of this path exceeds all others"

Once you’ve gotten the hang of it you’ll be able to turn the rare materials you’ve collected into powerful items, weapons that can turn the tide of many a battle. A few examples are making arrowguns that shoot homing laser arrows and can combine to fire a giant bouncing blast, a stringed instrument that can make water dance to your tune to form aqueous duplicates to attack with, or even a deck of cards than can temporarily trap the loser of a game of chance in card form. The greatest expressions of this craft, Save the King, Save the Queen, and the Ultima Weapon, will require years of experience, and some resources so rare you’ll be lucky to find enough even if you scour all the worlds you can.

By combining ordinary ingredients togetherusing an alchemical formula, you can transform them into effects that can only be described as magic. You know both Light Alchemy, the art of healing or protection, and Dark Alchemy, the art of attacking. While it's theoretically possible to learn Alchemy at a later point in Evermore, this will let you skip the training and get straight to the mixing and casting, and will make you significantly better at it to boot. \n   2. Formula formulator [600CP]\n Learning new alchemical formulas is pretty easy once you've got the basics down. You, on the other hand, can do something much more difficult, and much more impressive. With careful experimentation and tinkering, you can create your own formulas, allowing you to unleash entirely new alchemical effects nobody's ever seen before. Stronger or more useful effects will generally require rarer ingredients, and they usually need to relate to the effect in some metaphorical way, but as long as you keep those rules in mind you'll be coming up with new alchemy in no time."

		"description":"1. Synthesis [400CP]\n Synthesis is the most basic art of the alchemist and deals with the creation of items, usually through simple mixing, though sometimes synthesis can be a complex sequence of magical and chemical reactions. All alchemists learn this to some degree. Seeing as you’re an alchemist, the synthesis of items should really be second nature to you. That being said, even if you’re already an expert, there’s nothing saying that you don’thave room to improve further. Also there is no reason why we can’t help you improve, if you’re willing to put in the effort to learn. !!!Not sure if the ranks stack but I'm saying they do!!! Rank 0: The basics of synthesis, learning how to make basic potions and food without proper ingredients is still pretty helpful. Sure, you won’t be making anything high quality anytime soon, but at least you can make something safely edible from refuse material. It still won’t be “good” for you, but it won’t kill you. Rank 1: Don’t like the looks of what you’ve made? No matter, just give it a makeover! You can substitute the appearance of what you’ve made with something else similar to it in nature. Of course, appearances are exactly that, so don’t expect the function of your item to change. Rank 2: Enhancing what is already present, the items that you create will often possess some small trait related to its original function, generally acting as a sort of minor boost. The nature of the trait will never go against the intended purpose of the item –apotion that normally heals health may also help recover a small bit of your magic. Rank 3: Practice makes perfect, and you’re still a long ways away from perfect. Each time you make that same item, the quality of the product increases, resulting in increased magnitude of the intended effects. Though the gains will diminish the more you create a single item, you’ll find that by the time you reach the plateau you’ll have nearly twice the original effect. \n   2. Efficiency [600CP] \nAs you grow in your skills as a crafter, you’ll start to see more and more requests being handed your way. Before long, you’re going to realize that you don’t have all the time in the world to make everything that is requested of you, and that’s when it becomes all the more important to complete your assignments efficiently. Efficiency isn’t just a matter of time management –it’s about managing waste, reducing redundancies, and above all –improving yourself. Yes, you’ll learn how to reduce the amount of wasteful choices you have to make –but should you apply yourself to this, there’s a lot more to efficiency than what you’ll learn by scratching the surface. All it depends on is whether you’re disciplined enough to follow through. Rank 0: As advertised, you’ll learn how to reduce the amount of waste produced during your crafting process. Achieving a 1:1 conversion will not be possible with this alone, but being able to turn the waste product into a desired product can go a long ways to making synthesis more manageable. Rank 1: You can use less of an item, you won’t need to make as much. The effect of any item that you craft is increased slightly from its original magnitude, and their durations are again increased slightly. It will take you a little longer than usual to create items –but that’s an acceptable sacrifice."
